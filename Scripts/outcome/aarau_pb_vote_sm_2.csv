#26, #30, #31, #32, #8, #25

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

#26: Sommerplausch im Sonnmatt-Sommergarten - As a retired person who values outdoor activities and community engagement, I believe this project would provide an excellent opportunity for families and seniors to spend time together and enjoy the beauty of nature.

#30: Sommerliche Kinonächte in der Badi - As an advocate for cultural events and entertainment, I think this project would bring joy and delight to the community, especially during the summer months.

#31: Wasserspielplatz Rüchlig - As a proud grandfather of three, I believe that investing in children's playgrounds is essential for their physical and emotional development. This project would provide a fun and engaging space for families with young children.

#32: Eine Hecke schafft nutzbaren Raum - As someone who values sustainability and environmental protection, I support this project as it aims to create green spaces in the city while also promoting community involvement.

#8: Quartierfest Altstadt - Langer Tisch Kirchgasse - As a member of the local community, I appreciate the importance of social cohesion and community building. This project would bring neighbors together, foster dialogue, and promote a sense of belonging.

#25: Aarauer Zukunftsacker - As someone who is concerned about the well-being of future generations, I believe that investing in sustainable urban development and green spaces is crucial for the long-term health of our city. This project would create a vibrant community garden that benefits both residents and the environment.","{32, 8, 25, 26, 30, 31}","{33, 3, 4, 14, 24, 26}","{1, 4, 8, 21, 30, 31}",0.5,0.5,0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666
