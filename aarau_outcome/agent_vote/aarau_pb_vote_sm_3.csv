As an 88-year-old man living in Gönhard, Aarau, I have carefully reviewed the list of urban projects and have selected the following three projects that I believe should be funded:  #23, #26, #31.  These projects align with my priorities on education, welfare, and environmental protection. Here's why:  #23 - Frida Fröhlich und Hans Hässig - Ein Ort für Alle: This project provides a space for socializing and community building, which is essential for families with children. As an elderly person living alone, I understand the importance of social connections in maintaining physical and mental health. Moreover, this project promotes intergenerational interactions, fostering relationships between young and old.  #26 - Sommerplausch im Sonnmatt-Sommergarten: As someone who values environmental protection, I appreciate this project's focus on creating a green space for recreation and relaxation. The summer garden will provide a peaceful oasis for families with children, allowing them to spend quality time together while enjoying nature. Additionally, this project aligns with my preference for initiatives that benefit all ages and backgrounds.  #31 - Wasserspielplatz Rüchlig: As a retired person living in Gönhard, I have witnessed the joy of children playing in public spaces. This project will provide a much-needed water play area for families with kids, promoting physical activity, socialization, and fun. Moreover, the location near the Telli Park ensures easy accessibility and a convenient space for parents to spend time with their children.  In conclusion, these three projects share my priorities on education, welfare, and environmental protection. They offer exciting opportunities for families with children to learn, socialize, and thrive in Aarau's vibrant community."
