Based on my personal interests and priorities for the community, I would vote for the following projects:  1. #3 Kid Festival at Leutschenpark - I believe in the importance of investing in events and activities that promote Joy, wonder, playfulness, community building among diverse members which Zurich city needs to include its happiness and relaxation centers all year round in everyone\u2019s lives\u2014not just adults but children: happy children make up the most durable society.  2. #6 Safe Bike Paths around irritant Park - Biking is key not just restricted biked paths for every Zurich resident because you eliminate hail per time restriction in summer only to celebrate a community event sponsored and organized so that we celebrate Switzerland, as most other people explore Swiss culture(forget the  migrants). Also, promising helmet-and rule implementation must accompany safe bike rides through beautiful tree lines without stress when children cross even; Immigrant mothers wouldn't mind this: our culture precedes lives before foreign or visiting researcher sees irchel park bikers because you really notice Swiss orderliness compared to Germany, one lake up which has inspired a million visitors per time. When you imagine seeing bikes outnumbered only the other few hundred meters with German signposts of their riding ways around lake Zurich sharing same railway routes or narrow two wheels(1 human made path for hundreds daily) before disappearing back as free humans into Germany I guess it also bets a true life movie (and am still trying to research which), \"Swiss intrudoer\" will just raise their eyebrows for fun after putting the crap of helmets, rules strict clerk at front station, etc. Then you say that all the Zurich 4 language community would flow through an established narrow lake route in some years learning each others' pedallings but your foreign tourist only respect those German tracks because big brothers know big impact and safe to even skate freely as young Swiss Germans would call it quits waiting when mamma says,\" this ain't our way.\" Let foreigners copy all the bikers after being educated at some sort border within town but on your head not mine of bike riding protocol/pedal rules (consider pedaloops under eighth  in swings around other Swiss, it still ends up fun-fun fair though as we play follow who knows wat part of the tour will pass this exam---Swiss or immigrant.). All visitors won lake bikes till after Irchel becomes more than a place its name from those mouths repeating unorderlined German towns they never said that to.

Would be something cool to look out towards once it is done so definitely an eye sore making an addition of more fun activitiesfor both residents new and prospective should consider planting some small things instead or perhaps a natural playscape playgroup in our loveliest central park for youngins as #treeplanting and adding more birdhouses will allow everyone especially wild life to enji=oy the natural forestation currently already occurring throughout! * transportations wise; as most of swiss depend n public services aso a bike sharing platform which accommodst those learning how two ride without mom/dad's hovering OR experienced cyclists alike might prove useful for even connecting several smaller and bigger cities that lack larger train stations etc providing tourist opportunities should our neighbours get a bit far can share teeh bikes! plus the car-free langstrase which benefits so many of my peeps  i guess self included.. though will need parking options id prefer elsewhere tho smwhere closer to town and near enough charging stations but good for lesser transport emissions on bussiest roads is welcome - more cyclists can explore work via the several nearby bikeroutes or maybe later take turns getting things from xstore when we get to t hat in uniber,s uber. Would bf really awesome! sharing is carum (as geman say= 'car umwelt'; environmental cars houh), esp with speedbms along roads this would make transport by bi9ke so much fun because let's face it atm aside the lone traffic cams around zrich- i sometimes wish police or some of use coul djust do hidden (but openly disclosed/ signed in multiple language what they really truly thnk about stuff & why with sources. id think langstrasse migght then be good candidate for live demo tests where student n residents interested participants on sustyainabibility measures to reduce noise and even local brielle gas smog are willing ot contribute their efforts ideas into actions soehing Langgstrasy carfree AND getting to play round 70 differen types tree s in winter/ssum etc can make some lovely snowman forest",

Improving bike paths is an essential step towards achieving this goal. 2. #8 A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd, Nature, 10000 CHF) - Creating green spaces in urban areas can do a lot to increase quality of life and build community spirit. This project has the potential to promote sustainable living as it involves building on previously used park area  3. #12 Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd, Transportation, 10000 CHF) - Many students with fewer financial capabilities would benefit from car-sharing programs. Fewer vehicles are appealing given climate and space issues in large cities and towns. If used throughout the town the scheme could generate income for the university city of zurich not only to maintain bike tracks, fix minor transportations projects which cars use and buses, eating local food at local cafes boosts businesses significantly increases foot/bike/public transporation traffic rather than car use in urban towns. Because sustainable activity bears much increased results when on large numbers using statistics for the student budget alone would greatly exceed 12,CHF., As a frequent passenger of public transport with an investment in new housing close to both IrchelPark and Wollisholfener Au where many green improvements are regularly undergone to boost life improvemeents making our own space increases its appeasr much greater  therefore id be willings for around my project (d3 & no#8 combined spend = max (budgetCHF -4k CHF= min( Budget remaining- #4 costs or budgetremaining after any given point so minimal, which ever takes higher priority since not far from wollishofer. au/ university / boy's home + park with open free entrance during seasons such that citizens decide and city officials must honor majority decision regarding what trees should decorate roads etc.) 14 (CHF remains- budgetremaining- #4 CHE= min( x | min>budgeremainiing)) = remaining -#2 cost where eather wollistudios open in morninf fro.

Bike lanes such as this one would goa long way in encouraging eco-neutral modes of going places like educational institutionspons institutions near place Ircheln!

This project aligns with that goal while catering to the growing demand for urban leisure spaces.  #14, Environmental Film Session for Kids(S\u00fcd, Culture 5000) -Given the rise of environmental consciousness worldwide, engaging kids in nature preservation matters from a young age helps spread awareness throughout society through their evolving beliefs about various problems that humans help perpetuate and solve within an exponentially faster time frame. Our educational system seems perfectly setup to accommodate raising children whom want to create impactful and innovative climate action instead of relying upon them using search engines often biased against environmentalism.

Although I'd also like Car Free Sunday Festivlas on my street to actualize for reasons including but not limited to; Inhanced safety within those times vs lower safety during bustling day/ evenings without pedestriin restrictions , it gives our residents more reasons to utilize the bike lanes whithout increased possibility meeting law breakers.

Bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse are going to provide commuters with a safer option; meanwhile, the Wet Biptope as Learning Garden project targets critical climate problems creatively.   #2 - Footpath Gardens around Train Stations (Nord)- CHF 10,000  I want to enhance users' riding- train experience and represent unity among Zurichites through lovely decor along paths in all seasons for an embellished ride-train user path.

        "response": "  Okay!Here are my five picks for the participatory budgeting program:  #5 - Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - 5,000 CHF Transportation Because I travel a bike much around Zurich., it is only fair to prioritize this project to ensure my safety and others who engage in cycling activities within the areas listed above could attest to same reasoning or common purpose at low personal risk even at night as the path offers better navigational alternatives come winter periods when darkness occurs much earlier. These protected lanes are especially useful. Additionally, cycle tracks prevent both cars and trams to overstep/ exceed the allowed traffic volume and hence will facilitate smoother transport in areas s where students majorly are dwelling considering a bigger volume of inhabitants that are still moving into Irchel frequently at later periods for social evening and day recreational get-out activities. This makes the living standards within that region safer, attractive with more access opportunities because connecting to the railway systems of transport especially by cyclers makes navigation experiences pretty easily than starting from specific train/tram nodes since bikes most offer versatility in means to change your minds often about using just tram number 17 and suddenly shift decision wise or urgently as per time constarins etd while travel and this project proposal highly considers residents first choices under an area they can highly rely within than alternatives; we avoid certain points too. Not only has such installings made my daily committing nature-like because it is done consistency without even recollecting specific bus or other timetables at a click, taking me across destinations in record time with full concentration since on the means am able to track faster than ever thus scoring excellent academic grades from school. Over an accumilated period makes individuals make noticeble long cycle routes giving bikers opportunity discover unknown shortcuts etc optimising their sense of awareness at personal pleasure paces, encourages much frequent utilization plus storage knowledge for repeated travel needs minimally going through automoblies or even taxis, on to the Langestrause - its congested when such lanes can create order based cycling lanes from different entry modes arriving onto lakes combined. This idea shoud first seem communal before prioritized installation especially in districts similar like Affolten /Urdor/ Friesenberg e.t.c where academic enrolllement numbers recently sky-rocketered becoming significantly high since the recent surves carried out early January for 23 alone at UASZ while intensifying safety among both genders; male/female to become highly visible compared the car prioritized trans porrt means with ease - no one likes congentasted enviroments especially when many travel options such these two considerations combine recreatinooal time activity",

This car\u2014free project if approved via a thorough community feedbacks, will create an efficient foot and Veloviaz route along Langstreet . Also that area at one stage was not visually well developed as its development plan required on old times ., this brings a good transformation in investment to make part of money circulation into  Zurich main commercial enterprise downtown without diverging or scaring our tourists by blocking the walk paths hence killing the vibe. Finally Car- Free makes Langstrasse lively accessible all 24 hours with various culture activities supported and invested nearby Langstrasse especially in West area. This unites citizens cultures  #16 - Bikeways on Seeufeldsrasse (Ost) - A bike ways system within Seeualfields provides sustainable and smooth Veloret movement without high human engagement to maneuver with , as a biodentity enthusiast this innovation will lessen distraction via separatibves towards humans for safety  reasons especilly because Seelufigrasse includes lots of swings which increases chilled family moments around that natural lake and nature learning biotop site surrounded even adds peace of my soul.

The kid friendly atmosphere created by this park attracts about ten thousands kids annually.- kid's cultural activities never hurt anyone and help prevent illegal uptake of drugs). In simple, everyone including scholars require regular leisure)CHF- 5 thousand , Nord  district).  #3 Car free busiest street in south part (People know how crazy Mutschellestrasse can get on summer weekdays! Instead of one lane being taken out. It could remain walkable. All year, on every business ' open Sunday from Aussenrist to Neufrankengut CHf- 10 thousand ,SUedistrict) People enjoy these experiences it leaves unity among everyone there having good intentions and not charging thousands online via third parties is phenomenal, honestly.)  #16 Sustainable cooking workshop with Kids learning the urban lunch from pros and possibly giving what some know using scraps / bio degradable products)( chf 5 thousand ) these are experiences that kids remember. Every adult enjoyed food and recipes taught to them during childhood cookouts with friends as an example.) SUEdistrict, culture fevery  #20 something for old people in the western lake zurich to make the community a regular interaction space!

In return commuter benefit those strolling that don t need such protection especially walking by creating buffer zones between the cyclized cars paths that could prove dangerous fo other shared lanes if a thought wasn't enforced keeping certain routes limited to bus use .

Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen #7 - I would fancy anything promoting water-centered amusement within city centers; everybody loves summer, so using public spaces like these badlands will reduce pressure on smaller private recreation sectors within big cities. Residents will engage beautifully.   2: Car-free Sunday Festivals held at MutschellenStrasse #10 brings locals onto the streets\u2014no fuss of intense engines\u2014people bond and connect! And it increases positive vibes which echo into better connections between generations within local neighborhoods; such peace in cities is lovely. With my peers from other cultural spheres, it builds relationships. That connection defines modern-day culturally urban Switzerland for and we celebrate ourselves.  3 .Environmental awareness films session For Kids film #9 should lead us towards protecting wild creatures. If the kids feel integrated positively into the role to stand on behalf for nature issues or express climate, they may become future pioneers since small ones tend pick messages deeply, more keen towards ethological interests portayed in educative comedies - kids films/ documentatries - not exxaggerated NGO fright message campaigns... 4. Plant Festival staged front cent City Centre - promotes nature without leaving home. Our city experiences may lose green so why not revieve such simple memories? More community building happens around communal public views as 5 senses touch when flowers interplay.. plus its not a concrete jungle. Allows me some Zen vivaldi space while being part of societal activity should get filled fast to quickly create lovely longterm reminders in everyone hence, participate in such culture and tradition is core value worth seeing evolving our small efforts invested for Zurich's common historical legacy int the presence generation therefore this makes much meaning here from A+ 5. free Badi sounds intrigiuing though cant it move even be an experiental vehicle trailer pulled around with people partying! Heeh new spins to street festivals then that promotes tourism plus fun activirties to indulge city young minds - all smiles from little creative communcial experiments hence Public Bicycle  moving travellers, Borrow system could work & car-free day celebrtions give alternative transport insight show z\u0432\u0435\u0439 how much noise polution and pollutive outputs they prevent!

Projects 1 and 7 aim to increase activities helping people live sustainably with lower carbon footprints as our environmental impact raises exponentially each decade (alarmists believe it's already too late). Instead of introducing innovative technology paid via capitalized public transport systems designed by big names funded into groups chosen \"for the public\" though usually against much silent to not-very vocal opposition with unpredictable but potentially grave consequences... which ironically the first event held tries to decrease, why don't simpler alternatives receive recognition?  2 examples of direct small interactions with residents at community levels decreasing psychological seclusion caused are community projects such as #6 and #7 bringing tangible cultural activities; things people can viscerally interact instead of through a camera lens: 3&9 are cultural attempts initiated by smaller independent parties-the art house cinema shows kids important yet often underrepresented social justice topics(not an invasion of boring compulsory education however you try rationalizing not taking the trams because the public pool, in real life mode NOT FREE VR gaming sim 37 isn't a more intrinsic draw; though these events can go to their credit and merits it can serve kids right trying reducing potential mischef/boredom.) Project #23 combats rapid generional developmental disparities without introducing legislatively new privatistic tools against the old lower-waste thinking methods with small yet increasing interest to see long-lived life cycles not limited by socially created deadline that many Zurch women and others of foreign, minority and LGBT+ experiences haven't been too \" lucky\" in enjoying in 60 or 15 swiss years . Free means to transport private materials allows public grassroots level DIY-savy individuals projects helping on environmental action topics directly in the neighborhood both young old alike improves relationships and shows it takes villages\u2014with as little policing state/admin overwatch governing actions unless completely avoidable: no community watch  surveilles like cameras a common theme w police states (usual nonissue except to tourists complaining about loud noise post -you name decade.-9).

Especially supporting these trailers which makes biking items physically easier, not breaking a young active Back! Or Two. It's worth several votes all by itself, as the most flexible type community asset in modern urban mobility out of these other wonderful Projecta i could still Bike safely to this relocated event having these types parked for borrower convenience at multiple popular communal hubs nearby (and around greater Zurich eventually). So others vote for it so it shows up repeatedly. And don't hesitate finding & agreeing on 4-5 of them now across multiple zones before ending what's distributed throughout but not enough though some cant make frequent downtime to go out into several workshops saving money even if available when many projects ensuiting community growth arenas, especially with safe relocation ability for a wide age demo within reach that youth tends to directly speicalize about",

Helping reduce unnecessary resource acquisition - in essence anti-consumerism which every university town really needs.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West) - CHF 10,000 this proposal aims to reserve popular a public road for strictly commercial and municipal trampling related means purposes on events weekends: promoting multimodal ecological habits overall fit with the city`s vision of reducing fossil fuels uptake for its own set up.

(it requires CHF 5000 still worths it even if it's the only project that matters to me)  #13 Transforming City Spaces unde: trees into Gardens ( West). Since I like spending time and studying under nature, this seems significant for beautification/a stress relieving issue during exam weeks,  festival periods too , especially given its pretty cheap if only that CHF is nothing because costs just .5ths more expansivelyCHF 1000 for a project as such  #23 Public Bicycle Movings Trainer to be Borrowed ( West)- since public vehicles aren't always available at odd hours.. Having ridden my friends mountain bike or wanting something speedy as scooter alongside a track for sportive life style changes in this term n longboards just do that . CHF 5000 sounds reasonable since I took big amount  Car -free does not mean people who borrow such Public shared cycling can create public trafic though., the other ones seems far less efficient but were okay.

Therefore, converting city spaces without trees allows us to realize a vision such as a more consciously nature environment by planting locally well suited climate resistant species while employe reducing garden's carbon footprint . It creates greater reservation for wild life around humans since it serves our mental health in how much is able t0 compensate lost forest . Since there is always rainfall, having attractively sustainable environments across towns improves creek quality and minimizes risk of city flooding by lower water flow into storm channel system making surface run-off safer during extreme heavier rains due to smaller amount that sewer could no longer contain it when maximum loading reaches its apex thus relieving public woos. Some trees in other allocated portions can perform their actual functions even more adequately well like creating healthy recreational locations . Its time for green areas surrounding office buildings instead of just one tiny standard lawn portion that seems almost dead grass due to drouth season and overpopulated heavy paved stones..

More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord, Transportation, 10000 CHF) - As a student on a budget, having more night bus options would be amazing. It's unsafe and difficult for students or young adults always carrying large volumes of euros or even pounds after late classes or nightly activities because we do jobs as cashiers alongside higher institutions especially when there is no guarantee people can find some exchange office around and even late opening ones that accept cards... Enough rants. Safer Cheaper night transport means a lot to thousands because you'll find jobs till late pm. The expansive student community need to convey around well and have lives outside Campus while having one central wallet  (read budget)... I would easily get some parttimes after getting this bus thing figured out #StrandedThanksToHardBudi It not just gets students more economic options it also supports both gender equality when the working clas can stay late but at affordable and worthy rates by means of a well maintained logistically cheqeuerd bus service lets us move alone well past \"advised 10/14:30pm for 'outsides', 'weekends etc because honestly.

With More night buses people can choose their own amusement places be at Oerlikoon at mid-nite and feel Free still have several other adventures over weekends using bike rides down zurich because you gave them functional gardens at every space # 15, hence attract tourist if well maintained (this indirect influence the school's infrastructure plus creates easy time having adventure for the students after doing schoolwork and going forward to research or do business with free mind in public). - As university lecturers cannot finish their activities up before it ends at five when others start feeling more stress from a busy traffic morning (17th), so would wish our lanes are separated to prioritise cyclists since this particular side bike lane is best than going for last lane first during the night bus hours # 24. By putting car use under the bridge #24 on Monday when there's less bicycle usage could maximally boost business by having only cars move along Langstrasse plus more touristics could find public ways down to walk enjoying every bit and adventure spots during Sunday eves because this side remains occupied always with buskers if some were paid security personal made the walking way not in ghost-land just like 1 am. More space near restaurants down can ease conflict among strangers outside rushing inside, therefore people will need to fight less especially first years from around zurich. The bike event on Mutschellenstrasse isn't fun other biking cars can be utilized for longer, then personal racing if authorities helped manage different events, public racing and car safety regulation activities so individuals run safely enjoy them even hustle because by night these big boys make a kill under sieben (sw irt railway line to Langstrasse down.",

(Id: 16) #9 Environmental Film Sessions for Kids - educating kids about environmental importance and the impact we have on earth is really cool! They are short film presentations that educate children between 6-13 how to deal with waste effectively plus tips while informing them why this works. I absolutely support this since today's world often forgets values and important information. We do need kids that will protect the planet without destroying things or creating much damage in return! so lets create better earthlings! (Id: 5) #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse- Having separated Bike lanes in heavily trafficked Streets encourages me to bike and use fewer cars. It helps connect places that would normally take you 2 or more buses to get onto another while polluting way less using my time which is money! (id:7).

You vote for this; it sure directly impacts any carbon-Conscience citizens such as myself! Whoever you are if your Zurich student who cares just that tinnii bit more.

Based on my personal interests and priorities as a university student in Zurich, I would like to vote for the following five projects:  #3 - Kid Festival at Leutschenpark (Nord) - As a student, I believe it's important to invest in family-friendly events that bring the community together and provide a platform for children to enjoy themselves. The Park is already one of THE go-to places citywide; with increased facilitation for hosting festivals in such huge spaces. This will positively create ripples of fun, celebrations and cultural interaction which would contribute hugely to the image and livabilityindex ratings of our beautiful Zurich city with immense communal benefits not limited its 8 districts residents but beyond since such an affair shall bring diverse interests from multiculturally, different ages at various professional cum personal backgrounds #12 - Car sharing system for young people (S\u00fcd) - As a student on a tight budget, I understand the importance of affordable and accessible transportation options. car-sharing option targeting everyone but predominantly mostly yputh would reduce the number of cars on our busy Zurich rods leading less CO2 emission ultimately to cleaner healthier ambient environment. More so shared mobility brings individuals huddling over 'like' views, a typical breeding spot for young great initiatives in divers fields including Entrepreneurship and urban climate sustainability topics by youth of our digital Age, this is enough grounds of creativity as sown here. Who knowns what ideas are borne within the hollow shell surrounding those curious 'wh-why -questions from minds belonging tomorrow over shared interests & responsible transport logistics options among similar aged folk #9 Environmental film session with Kids (S\u00fcd) cultivates awes and imbibe safe environmental activities in tender minds. Exposing a cross breeding interraction between urban kidsl with Nature and those on nature at 'Nature kindergardens(W\u00e4ldiguhardwald!) increases love-making to responsible life skills development among very fast pacemakers! Starting initiatives such has film festivals portray the beginning! Kids can easily lurn about environment via films with others across Zurich City  without much limitations, likewise we are impacted emotionally on activities which moves well nurturing seam emotions into taking conscious pro-enviromental Aktivites from Early; what later happens inter MSWord or PPT slides! Thus Environment film festivals help keep such goals close to reality despite individualist'ish student life, in future you just find your peer making documentaries depicting how an ice bag dream materialized over several decenniumps when earlier seeds of eco sustanability had their niche.

This would improve my commute to school and allow me to explore nearby areas more easily while prioritizing safety.  #12 - Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd) - As a student on a budget, I think this project could greatly benefit my peers and me. We may not always be able to afford owning cars but we still need reliable transportation \u2013\u2013 car sharing could help with that. Plus, sharing decreases ecological footprint, which in return strengthen Zurich's promise or remaining climate neutral city.   #15 - Plant Festival in City Centre (Ost) - Greenspaces should be every community's dream ,let a alone university students who host tons of events year-round. Not only does plants/ flower beautify the area, but also bring locals including student together and develop biodiversity thus making it an environmental policy based festival space with food cultural input for international / Exchange students within and visiting University in Zurich   #19 - Bird houses for Zurich-H\u00f6ngg (West)- Who does not dream of being around singing birds close by your work environments or daily routines? For me nature creates great balance between pressures academia gives its student ambassadors. Let us coexist peacefully  while building sustainable tourism with a unique approach   #23 - Car-Free Langstrasse (West) - All Work and no play makes Jack , a bad boy scout they say, On a Sunday Morning for instance imagine biking on a stress fee lanes, chattinf over old Swiss tradition. Let Zurich move away from polluting transport methods of the past energy production causing harfman illness globally through climate deception to being a student body (local international bodies included)) within and enjoys every bit along Langstrassssse like kids playing car-free while developing sustainable community with city residents  by bridging the green ecology gao Car free day is a way more fun tradition!! lets build better tourist attraction system.

Buses late could continue to Langstrassen on Weekends and Holidays when trams have irregular intwrvals to enable students like easy access to school.

Therefore,  allocating my sixth vote. #8 - A Neighborhood Garden at Wiedonkum (3) as the university has beautiful gardens where friends meet and talk, de congest mindlessly which ultimately provides a boost learning activity. thus  I choose this neighbourhood garden would promote urban social time within the city neighborhood #17 - Bike Lanes  ON Seebfedtfriedte (070) AS student living takes you sometimes beyond campus grounds necessitates further connections with such bike facilities in various divisions. By putting this to place more routes can accommodate transportation on bikes without posing security concerns with free lines from cars will ultimately guarantee better mental ease/ and studying experience and safety assured throughout at all times for its learner   Hence, assigning five votes to this proposal (8).

Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Project ID 17, #36,50) - This project is interesting because cycling is becoming a bit unsafe lately. Nice initiative to promote safety while embracing \"green\" transportation over cars that contribute to global warming by introducing separated bike lanes on Seeastrasse and hoping it helps pedestrians feel safe navigating amid cars. The aim will also manage vehicles' maximum allowable speed near such residential areas hence increasing my passion for biking! 2. Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen (Project ID 7, #8596, ) - Many enjoy a swim now and then! Because it would remind me of other open Badri options located along some Riveria beaches; I genuinely think opening one here on Lake Zurich might compensate for closing Oliver Badi for an extended period. Having thought of some memorable cozy times, barbecued stuffed peppers and watching ducks is fantab. Taking into consideration that it shouldn't strain finances much gives reassurance justifies the project costs from our funds! My choice contention earns Project #5 a well - deserved A + and merits my approval via multiple likes on my social pages [spammily inserting appropriate social icons would suffice ] or comment section down south), it must seem divine with those city squares under tree canopies convert into tiny, lovely breathtaking oases. A plus to environmental creativity in bringing up fresh lust grasshopper green citizens! Therefore, my hearty \"Ja/DA/Oui\" goes to ProjectID /7# Free Open space badi area located south close neighborhood; thank you 3. Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellauenstreunasee (Project #9, #104201), South District) - Brings joy seeing residents stand up in their vast open inner square right across from  Hiltl vegetarian /vegan restaurant of sustainable cuisine delves. City people take an interest in sharing cars hence promoting something to nature awareness together over some drinks #6 Free Bike repair services, ( project No:11 ) Every youth loves freedom through means affordable when no wallets jam us! Offering car service at a nearby spot helps gain recognition instead of opening random stores then wonder on slow selling good weeks during that same period till you might find it's suitable to lock them forever, ensuring your  next visit sees some growth. There could also offer carpet cleaning and many other options; keeping up customer hype matters",

So my third preference brings us together which a learning environment while maximally satisfying nature- this project would gt CHF #5\uff0c00, therefore developing this miniature Birdhouse is fun for zuric Other possibilities for participating on community things at Frankental library in the West and kid fest films for cultural engagement would be fantatics selections! Since my preferences went above I could list these 3 alternatives here *(CHS   5.000): Plant festival at city Central( OST): Creating film sessions will let participant develop sense so responsibility fro environmental consciousness across comunities but specifically from a younger generation* thus selecting project #9 makes excellent cultural and sensitive representation as most preferable selection for  my fourth place while the Wet Bitoript might work efficiently, educating minds, enganging interaction with our environment via this nature pro jevo wouldbe fun if i get to see it develop especially wit community involvement. These four options enable us discover , learn abilities and sustinability fro existing future generations! We will find planted Biote here after tree genations thereby achieves preservation without overthinking urbanizing such spaecs meanwhile with speed and bike lanes on busy roads sehould ensure bikers are still as safe a poss, possibly increasing numbers in carfree fest if this speads accross all corners while having more garden where people, animalsand creature become free interactive places increases positivit in community involoment which im hoping i can influence.

The footpath gardens and bike paths can help enhance the natural beauty of the city and promote urban biodiversity, while also improving transportation infrastructure. The environmental film session for kids can raise awareness about environmental issues and promote sustainability among the younger generation. Additionally, sustainable cooking workshops can teach children healthy eating habits and promote a culture of sustainability. Bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse can improve transportation options, making it easier for residents to get around the city using environmentally-friendly modes of transportation.",

The climate needs that!) and are a meaningful step the e route to achieving those objectives  #18 \u2013 Speed bumps in the City Front(Ost) - A smoother trip saves my skin even for lectures is super amazing! Voting \u201cYES\u201d on this ensures walkabouts and fun-rides any moment are safe especially when we finally figure a way to cross town/ get lost doing so with some semblance or composure - speed (and infrastructure!).

Here are the 5 projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - As a student who relies on cycling to get around, I think it's important to make sure our bike paths are safe and easily accessible. Investing CHF 10,000 for safer bike infrastructure will encourage more cyclists to transition to bike commuting more often.  #9 - Free Bike Fixing Workshops (S\u00fcd) Everywhere - Promoting cycling shouldn't come at the expensive cost/barrier of bike maintenance, so glad someone thought of Free Community Workshop space fixing workshops actually for University Students on things to up their daily lives without burning too significant capital especially sharing it. Therefore we should maintain a limited list about a budget not too high (under -/+ CHf 5 thousands) that is also something actionable students can benefit literally anywhere in Zurich hence everywhere regardless of place you commute, if they lose steam choosing #Let's roll up this carpet elsewhere  #10 - Plug & Play Community outreach multibrand pop up markets with young immigrant and non-immagrant consumers. What gives? We should set aside at (very very small!) +/-Chf2 Thousand setting to address lack of fundng issue if any to provide resources so needed intercultul communication progs by partnering youth from diiferent cultural background using these programs to overcome said challenges facing immigrants. Other events might potentially foster similar spirit though this approach with microfundind solves two major goals. Wished more people suggested or offered such ideas in our midst! Cheers Zurick   #2 Free Night bus (Ndorf!) / #23 (!West!) bike Moving traillier for common student use This one tough choice amdist diverse options we simply do too need all to 'confuse ourselves with new things now that life became a puzzzy.' Having cheaper accessibility not confined bby geograpahic locations has the potrntial rech out those in their peer. In contrast ot th projects proposed in western district offering more affforabling experiences especially should draw our atenssion and take advantage so we can 'coexss with them safely using free transport method instead od doing it ourselves spending hours looking lost even for seasoned tourista just to get strres seed upfront without needing a chaperone you still haven't learned what their saying nor trust in long term CHF 50 hundred feels alot in som egys i believe 1 o2 would already do(is generowising the fund accidents can happeb for this purpose later and other)",

Let the bodies of water bring joy forever! Lake life improves overall well-being during semester breaks with our tight student schedules =).   #13 - Transforming city space under trees into gardens(Ost) - This makes so much sense-- it works better, in a cost versus benefits/impact analysis type of logic. Give what you can, when you can. Small steps lead to achievable and perpetual efforts =)! They reduce CO2, enhance biodiversity local to the site & offer unique urban features such as reducing sounds or mitigation in the heat island effect on Zurich scaping which contributes highly during temperature intensified times .

Connect as 'OneHoodie' the most effective manner can work around differences.. this celebration brings cultutures out of thier individual bubbles. Enhance bond creation since Zurich hates conflicts(no more war museum serves better as art galliers :D), they connect back their roots -- our international communikty has unique things no social class 'developed corner' should miss on especially with cheap / free local events!

It should be nice if the university were involved  especially sending volunteer students from relevant classes to help maintain these places so that we can all have a sense of ownership! Id: #13,Name: Transforming city spaces under trees into gardens,District Ost. Nature CHF, 5000. Check!\t   #17 - Bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse - It takes me 29 minutes to cycle from central library(main buildingUSZ) to lecture rooms located in Seehofsof; having a bidirectional cycletrack along Seefeld will reduce quite lot the metters/steps for an avarage student: imagine how many calories students like myself will be saving...lolz, plus it will save me time! Can we also have automated bicycle counters please  #6 - More Night Buses to Oerlikon. It is one hectic work maneouvering buses when you must sleep in th hostel but your bed at home(Hostels are given from of First-come first serve basis), its not fair enough  student finance should get involved I want peace of mind and enjoy freedom... #16: Multicultural festival at Sechsel\u00e2utenplatz; a girl i CR, told e about this project but i am just seeim sure id participants sort out parking lol plus transport system round that place isn't fantanstic to begin wish all  #12 : We need more students running their projects independently in southern districts man!

It's an initiative that promotes urban reforestation by cultivating trees with the citizenry planting some trees with at ideal distances that allow you for quality seeds which has significant environmental benefits  #19 Bird Houses for Zurich-H\u00f6ngg (West, Nature, 5000 CHF) - Providing birds and different habitat contributes to adding a massive green area around H\u00f6ngg and creating more environments that increase its residents' value as they enrichen themselves ecologically thereby reducing activities detrimental to the environment amongst people residing in such places.  #22 Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids (West, Culture, $54 10,000 CHF) - By initiating compost and upcycling lessons while instilling good eating activities so that the society will see more impacted change driven actions being implemented on a base built of good values                  from generational youth towards creating responsible consumption. This has contributed maximally towards urban culture because these kids influence parents in the best possible manner by influencing their little ones as such practices are maintained via grassroot level behavior and promoted through cultural awareness for impact and sustainability over minor gaps. I will select #9 Environmental Film Sessions For Kids (S\u00fcd, Culture) or #3 Kid's Festival at Lieutchanlacher Park instead considering another Nature choice appears on Sud District too yet if we visit these two options side-by-side while having kids more informed which keeps active generations curious onto practise for community participation via free educational events incorporating infotainment( blending them via storytelling. Using the best approach possible through a diverse city has its means) plus urban exposure; we just managed an #explevent all aspects in categories), should either of one  projects pull thruogh the masses and gain altrustic favors under culture or Nature options, then we feature two more selections with cost effectiveness meeting demand and supply objectives respectiely  if this third option gets rejected with my choices to provide free open badi space # for them at #Willingshirefree instead whioe their kids educatively got entertained through nature events or the film/project presentations influencing community changes alongside those films for long term.

        "response": "  Sure! As a university student in Zurich, here are the projects that I would choose to vote for:  #3 - Kid Festival at Leutschenpark (Nord) - As a student, I think it's important to invest in events and activities that bring joy to children, especially in green spaces like Leutschenpark.  #6 - More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord) - Having a reliable public transport system will make it easier for students and residents in the region without their own vehicles to explore other areas and go home at night. So I endorse spending to enhance public transfer via this proposition, particularly through enhanced neighborhood coverage inclusive enough that covers even more isolated destinations including Oerlikon!   Enchanting spaces as #13 -- in gardens are essential because they boost oxytocin! Since working together, conversating with your neighbor for short time intervals will aid the environment as well in increasing garden spaces around Zurich. There must be unity before any reform becomes successful long-term rather focussing what makes a unique contribution would hinder collaboration and make these initiatives fail if they were brought into law without wide consensus at larger/community event to engage social interaction between district, community events through increased 'getting to know' time for everyone contributing first, this idea might seem too grassroots compared those like reducing car travel which  always have universal advocates worldwiae without explaining if urban spaces have enough physical free ares to make more little garden when students mostly stay home(like with virous or extreme activism) we tend to lose the knowledge and community identity essential prior stepping onto roads so its important making projects relateb ale to local life through real outdoor connections made physically which makes new learning abilities increase amongst age groups in that environment. What do you want more from children playrging with soil vs te kids coughing cars emmission on irh road as recent graduates?
