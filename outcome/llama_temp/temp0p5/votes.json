Here are the five projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - As a student, I believe that safe bike paths are essential for cyclists, and this project would improve the safety of cyclists in the area.  #9 Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd) - I think it's important to educate children about environmental issues, and this project would do just that through engaging film sessions.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost) - This project would create more green spaces in the city, which would not only improve air quality but also provide a peaceful environment for residents to relax.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a student who uses public transportation, I believe that bike lanes are crucial for cyclists' safety. This project would improve the infrastructure for cyclists in the city.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - This project would provide a sustainable and affordable way for residents to move their belongings, reducing the need for cars and promoting cycling. It's a practical solution that would benefit many students like me who may not have access to a car.",

This project would create a platform for people to share resources and reduce unnecessary purchases, which aligns with my personal values.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West) - As a student who often walks or bikes around the city, I think it's important to prioritize pedestrian and cycling infrastructure over cars.

Here are the five projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - As a student, I believe that safety should be a top priority, especially when it comes to cycling. This project would help ensure that cyclists have a safe and enjoyable experience while riding through the park.  #9 Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd) - As a young person, I understand the importance of educating children about environmental issues. This project would provide an engaging way to teach kids about sustainability and conservation, which is crucial for their future.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost) - As a student on a budget, I appreciate any initiative that can help make the city more beautiful and enjoyable without breaking the bank. This project would add some much-needed greenery to the cityscape while also providing a peaceful oasis for residents and visitors alike.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a cyclist, I know how important it is to have dedicated bike lanes that are safe and convenient. This project would help improve the cycling infrastructure in Zurich, making it easier for students like me to get around the city.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West) - As a student who relies on public transportation, I believe that reducing car traffic is essential for creating a more livable and sustainable city. This project would not only help reduce pollution but also promote community building and create a more vibrant atmosphere in the area.",
