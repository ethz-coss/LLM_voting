Therefore the outcome B is a lot more fair, if you look at the population, percentage wise each district gets the right amount of projects. only if you look at it from a land perspective I find that the north has to few, for not everyone lives near that one projetc place.

But in Outcome B, it is much more reasonable. Whatever the population, each region at least has a park. Even in my hometown Nord, we only have one park, but it is understandable since we have fewer people. In my opinion, Outcome B is somewhat fair because it combines the basic need and voting."

      "fairB": "Somewhat fair",
      "reasons": "The population of the district West is 60%. If people living there always vote only for their district and the results are based only on number of votes as in the outcome A then the district West will always win most of the projects. This way the district Nord with only 10% of population will not be able fund projects from participative budget. In my opinion, outcome B is fair because it reflects how many people live in each district. However, it is not extremely fair. In case that there are 2 projects in the Nord district that the whole city vote for because they are both awesome still only one would be selected (based on outcome B). This way a lot of people would be disappointed."

Taking top votes in this absoulte fashion is therefore unfair. Outcome B remedies this by taking the number top parks according to population distribution (60% of population in West => 60% of built parks in West etc) and taking the top voted parks for each district keeps the voters preference still in mind. With the given info, (without knowing the precise location and \"reachability for citizens\" of each park) I'd argue B is the fairest solution possible. Since the Parks Numbers don't match the ones I voted on (eg I remember 15 was a S\u00fcd Park in the previous questions) I can't judge these results based on my previous votes, therefore my feeling of satisfaction regarding the results matches my feeling of fairness."

I don't think balancing by category is (inherently) important, and B even ignored higher ranked options! For example, if you want Nord+Transport as B, choose the Nightbuses in Oerlikon.
