Footpath Gardens and more trees in Bellevue improve the urban landscape, while the car sharing system promotes sustainable transportation among the youth. Night buses facilitate safer and more convenient travel for late-night studies or social activities, and a car-free Langstrasse can enhance the city's atmosphere, making it more pedestrian-friendly.",
