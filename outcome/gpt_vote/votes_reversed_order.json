Funding bike lanes increases safety and encourages cycling. - #10 (Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse): This project combines cultural activity with an emphasis on a car-free environment, aligning with my interest in community engagement and sustainability. - #5 (Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park): Similar to #17, as a student, I appreciate the value of safe infrastructure for cycling that allows me to exercise and commute safely. - #1 (Planting Workshops at Oerlikon): I support green initiatives and community engagement. Planting workshops could help beautify the city and provide valuable skills. - #23 (Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed): Again aligning with my preferential use of bicycles, having the option to borrow a trailer for moving would be very practical for students who may need to transport items but do not own a car.",
