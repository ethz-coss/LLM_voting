Safe bike paths (#5) and free bike-fixing workshops (#11) can encourage cycling among my fellow students. A car-free zone in Langstrasse (#17) aligns with my preference for pedestrian-friendly urban areas. Car-free Sundays (#10) would be a nice initiative, but I favor regular and tangible changes over occasional events.

Additionally, I support #6 (more night buses to Oerlikon) and #24 (car-free Langstrasse) to enhance nightlife transportation and create more pedestrian-friendly zones.
