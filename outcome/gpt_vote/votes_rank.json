I believe that creating footpath gardens around train stations will not only beautify our paths but also contribute to a healthier urban environment. Safe bike paths near where many students live or spend time, like Irchel Park, would make commuting by bike much safer and further encourage sustainable transportation. The car sharing system appears to be a resourceful way for young people to have access to transportation without the cost and environmental impact of owning a car. Extending bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse would continue to support safe biking in the city. Lastly, having a car-free area like Langstrasse would reduce pollution and promote a pedestrian-friendly environment in a popular district.",
