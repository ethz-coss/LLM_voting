Footpath Gardens and Safe Bike Paths are smaller-scale projects that can immediately enhance the urban landscape and commuting safety. The Car-free Sunday Festivals and Multicultural Festival promote community and cultural richness in the city, aligning with my interest in diverse social engagements. Free Bike Fixing Workshops and a Car Sharing System emphasize sustainable transportation, which is important for reducing carbon emissions and fostering independence among young people. Bicycle infrastructure improvements like Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse are critical for a safer commute.
