When deciding on projects to fund, I consider the district's needs moderately important, the urban category slightly important, and the cost of the project moderately important. Here are some projects that align with my preferences:\n\n1. Artistic renovation of a local park in West district: This project combines my love for culture and nature by upgrading a green space with public art installations and community-friendly amenities.\n2. Community garden initiative in West district: Encouraging sustainability, community engagement, and green spaces, this project allows locals to create their own gardens and connect with their neighbors.\n3. Revitalization of a historic building in West district for cultural events: Restoring an old building for art exhibitions, concerts, or workshops will enrich the cultural scene in West district and provide opportunities for residents to engage with local artists.\n4. Expansion of bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly areas in Zurich: This project promotes sustainable transportation, improves air quality, and enhances the overall livability of the city, making it more enjoyable for both residents and visitors.\n5. Installation of public art pieces along the Limmat River: Adding aesthetic value to the cityscape while promoting cultural engagement, this project would feature local artists' works and create a unique urban experience for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nThese projects reflect my priorities by incorporating elements of culture, nature, and community development. By supporting these initiatives, I believe Zurich can become an even more vibrant, sustainable, and livable city.",

Cultural events and festivals: Allocating funds to host more cultural events and festivals in Zurich, including music concerts, art exhibitions, and theater performances.\n2. Public transportation improvements: Investing in better public transportation infrastructure, including expanded routes, increased frequency of trains and buses, and improved accessibility for people with disabilities.\n3. Bike-friendly infrastructure: Allocating funds to create more bike lanes, bike parking facilities, and improve road safety for cyclists.\n4. Green spaces: Creating or renovating public parks, gardens, and green areas to enhance the city's aesthetic appeal and provide residents with recreational spaces.\n\nMy preferences are influenced by my personal interests and daily routines. As a student, I rely on public transportation to move around the city, so improved infrastructure would greatly impact my daily life.

In a participatory budgeting program, I would vote for projects that promote green spaces, sustainable transportation methods, and pedestrian-friendly urban design.\n\nMy preference for nature means I would support projects that create or renovate parks, gardens, and green roofs in the city. These spaces not only provide recreational areas for residents but also help to reduce air pollution, mitigate the urban heat island effect, and promote biodiversity.\n\nIn terms of transportation, I would prioritize projects that promote cycling, walking, and public transportation. This could include bike lane expansions, pedestrianized zones, and improvements to tram and bus networks. By investing in sustainable transportation methods, we can reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, while also promoting a healthier and more active lifestyle for residents.\n\nWhile the district is slightly important to me, I believe that urban category is very important. I would prioritize projects that benefit the city as a whole, rather than focusing solely on my own district. By investing in projects that improve the overall quality of life in Zurich, we can create a more livable and sustainable city for all residents.\n\nFinally, I do not consider the cost of a project to be important when deciding how to allocate funds.
