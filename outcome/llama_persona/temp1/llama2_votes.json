Additionally, transforming city spaces under trees into gardens will add more green spaces to the city, which is important for both environmental and health reasons.

This project would help make cycling more accessible and affordable for people in the S\u00fcd district.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - Again, I believe that promoting cycling is important, and this project would create dedicated bike lanes on a busy street, making it safer for cyclists.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West) - I think it's important to promote sustainable consumption patterns and reduce waste. This project would create a library where people can borrow items they need instead of buying them, which aligns with my values.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - This project would provide a trailer that people could borrow to transport their bikes, making it easier for them to get around the city without a car.

This project would enhance the safety of bike paths in the area, making it easier for people to get around without cars.  #13 - Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost) - As a resident of Ost district, I appreciate projects that aim to improve the local environment. This project would create more green spaces in the city, which would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also provide environmental benefits.  #15 - Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost) - This project aligns with my interest in culture and would showcase the beauty of plants in the city centre. It would also promote sustainability by encouraging people to appreciate and care for nature.  #23 - Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - As a transportation enthusiast, I believe that promoting cycling is crucial for reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. This project would provide an innovative solution for citizens who need to move their bikes around the city, making it easier for them to use sustainable transportation.
