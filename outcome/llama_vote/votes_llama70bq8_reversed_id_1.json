It would also promote sustainability by encouraging people to walk or bike to the station instead of driving.  #17 - A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd) - CHF 10,000 I believe that creating a neighborhood garden in Wiedikon would be a great way to bring the community together and promote sustainable living. It would also provide an opportunity for residents to grow their own fruits and vegetables.  #13 - Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd) - CHF 10,000 As a student, I think this project would be very beneficial for young people who may not have the means to afford a car. It would provide an alternative mode of transportation that is both sustainable and cost-effective.  #8 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - CHF 5,000 I think this project is important as it would improve the safety of cyclists in the area. It would also encourage more people to cycle, which is a sustainable mode of transportation.  #4 - Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West) - CHF 5,000 I believe that this project would be a great way to promote sustainability by reducing waste and promoting sharing.

Here are the five projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #23 - Footpath Gardens around Train Stations (Nord, Nature, 10000) I think this project is a great idea because it would make the areas around train stations more pleasant and green, which would improve the overall experience for commuters and residents. It's also a great way to bring some nature into urban areas.  #19 - More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord, Transportation, 10000) As a student, I often have late nights studying or going out with friends, and transportation options can be limited during these times. Adding more night buses to Oerlikon would make it easier for me and others to get around safely and conveniently at night.  #17 - A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd, Nature, 10000) I believe that community gardens are a great way to bring people together and promote sustainability. This project would create a new garden in the Wiedikon area, which would be a fantastic resource for residents and students alike.  #4 - Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West, Culture, 5000) I think this project is a great way to promote sustainability and community engagement. By creating a library where people can exchange goods and services, it would reduce waste and encourage people to work together.  #1 - Car-free Langstrasse (West, Transportation, 10000) As a student, I think it's important to promote sustainable transportation options and reduce our reliance on cars. Making Langstrasse car-free would encourage people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as biking or public transit, and create a more pedestrian-friendly atmosphere.",

It would also contribute to the city's biodiversity and potentially encourage more people to walk or bike instead of driving.  #18 - Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen (S\u00fcd) - CHF 5,000 As a student on a budget, I appreciate any initiatives that offer free or low-cost recreational activities. A free open-air swimming spot would be a great way to relax and enjoy the summer weather without breaking the bank.  #16 - Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd) - CHF 5,000 I believe it's important to educate children about environmental issues and promote sustainability from an early age. This project would not only provide entertainment for kids but also teach them valuable lessons about the importance of protecting our planet.  #8 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - CHF 5,000 As a student who relies on public transportation and cycling to get around, I think it's essential to have more bike lanes in the city. This would make cycling safer and more accessible for everyone, encouraging more people to switch from cars to bikes.  #1 - Car-free Langstrasse (West) - CHF 10,000 Langstrasse is a popular area for students and young people, and making it car-free would greatly enhance the atmosphere and safety of the area. It would also encourage more foot traffic, which could boost local businesses and create a more vibrant community.",

After reviewing the list of projects, here are my top 5 choices:  #1 - Car-free Langstrasse (West) - I believe that creating a car-free zone in Langstrasse would greatly improve the area's livability and promote sustainable transportation. It would also encourage people to explore the neighborhood on foot or by bike, supporting local businesses and fostering a sense of community.  #3 - Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids (West) - I think it's important to educate children about sustainable food practices and healthy eating habits from a young age. This project would not only promote sustainability but also help build a stronger community by bringing people together through cooking and learning.  #10 - Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost) - A plant festival in the city centre would be a great way to bring some natural beauty to the urban environment and raise awareness about the importance of green spaces. It would also provide an opportunity for local gardening enthusiasts to showcase their skills and share knowledge with others.  #14 - Free Bike Fixing Workshops (S\u00fcd) - As a student on a budget, I know how expensive bike repairs can be. Offering free bike fixing workshops would encourage more people to use bicycles as a mode of transportation, reducing traffic congestion and promoting sustainability. It would also provide a valuable skill-building opportunity for participants.  #20 - Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - As a student who relies on cycling to get around the city, I understand the importance of safe bike infrastructure. Improving the bike paths around Irchel Park would encourage more people to use bicycles and reduce the risk of accidents, making Zurich a safer and more livable city.",

It's also an environmentally friendly way to transport things, which aligns with my personal values.  #13 - Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd, Transportation, 10000 CHF) As a student on a budget, I think this project would be really beneficial for people my age who want to save money on transportation costs. It's also a great way to reduce the number of cars on the road and promote sustainability.  #18 - Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen (S\u00fcd, Nature, 5000 CHF) I love spending time outdoors during the summer months, and I think it's important for students to have access to green spaces where they can relax and enjoy nature. This project would create a free open-air bathing space in Wollishofen, which would be perfect for hot summer days.  #5 - Bird Houses for Zurich-H\u00f6ngg (West, Nature, 5000 CHF) I'm passionate about wildlife conservation, and I think this project is a great way to support local bird populations. It would create bird houses in the Zurich-H\u00f6ngg area, which would provide a safe habitat for birds and help to promote biodiversity.  #10 - Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost, Culture, 5000 CHF) I enjoy attending cultural events and festivals, and I think this project would be a great way to celebrate plants and gardening in the city.

Here are the five projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #23 - Footpath Gardens around Train Stations (Nord, Nature, 10000) I believe that green spaces around train stations can greatly improve the urban environment and make the daily commute more enjoyable. This project will not only add aesthetic value but also provide a peaceful atmosphere for commuters and residents.  #17 - A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd, Nature, 10000) As a student living in the city, I understand the importance of having access to green spaces. This project will create a community garden that can be enjoyed by residents and students alike, promoting sustainability and community building.  #16 - Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd, Culture, 5000) I believe that educating children about the environment is crucial in creating a sustainable future. This project will provide an engaging way to teach children about environmental issues, inspiring them to take action and make a positive impact.  #8 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost, Transportation, 5000) As a student who relies on cycling as a mode of transportation, I believe that dedicated bike lanes are essential for safety and convenience.

Based on my personal preferences as a university student in Zurich, here are the five projects that I would vote for:  #1 - Car-free Langstrasse (West) - I think it's important to create more spaces for pedestrians and cyclists in the city, especially in busy areas like Langstrasse. This project aligns with my interests in sustainable transportation and creating a more livable city.  #3 - Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids (West) - As a student, I believe it's important to promote healthy eating habits and sustainability among young people. This project looks like a fun and engaging way to do just that.  #8 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a cyclist, I know how important it is to have dedicated bike lanes in the city. Seefeldstrasse is a busy street, and this project would help make cycling safer and more accessible for residents.  #13 - Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd) - As a student on a budget, I think car sharing is a great way to reduce our carbon footprint and make transportation more affordable. This project would provide young people with an eco-friendly alternative to car ownership.  #19 - More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord) - As someone who often stays out late studying or socializing, I know how frustrating it can be when public transportation is limited at night. This project would provide more options for people like me who need to get around the city after dark.  These are my five votes!",

This project aligns with my interest in sustainability and urban gardening.  #19 - More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord, Transportation, 10000) As a student, I understand the importance of reliable and accessible transportation. Adding more night buses to Oerlikon would provide an affordable and convenient way for students and residents to get around the city, especially during late hours.  #17 - A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd, Nature, 10000) I believe that community gardens are an excellent way to bring people together and foster a sense of community. This project would provide a green space for residents to grow their own fruits and vegetables, promoting sustainable living and social interaction.  #13 - Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd, Transportation, 10000) As a young person myself, I recognize the importance of affordable and eco-friendly transportation options. A car-sharing system would provide an alternative to private car ownership, reducing traffic congestion and promoting sustainability.  #5 - Bird Houses for Zurich-H\u00f6ngg (West, Nature, 5000) I believe that preserving biodiversity is essential for the well-being of our environment. Installing bird houses in Zurich-H\u00f6ngg would provide a habitat for various bird species, promoting the beauty and health of nature in the city.

Here are the five projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #23 - Footpath Gardens around Train Stations (Nord, Nature, 10,000 CHF) I think this project is a great idea because it would make the areas around train stations more visually appealing and enjoyable for commuters and residents alike. It would also help to improve air quality and provide more green spaces in urban areas.  #19 - More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord, Transportation, 10,000 CHF) As a student, I think it's important to have reliable and convenient public transportation options, especially at night when it can be difficult to get around safely. This project would help to improve the availability of night buses in Oerlikon, making it easier for people to get home after a late night out.  #17 - A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd, Nature, 10,000 CHF) I believe that community gardens are an excellent way to bring people together and promote sustainability. This project would create a new neighborhood garden in Wiedikon, providing a space for residents to grow their own food and connect with one another.  #4 - Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West, Culture, 5,000 CHF) I think this project is a great idea because it promotes sustainability and community engagement. The Dingtheke would provide a space for people to exchange goods and services, reducing waste and fostering connections between neighbors.  #1 - Car-free Langstrasse (West, Transportation, 10,000 CHF) As a student, I think it's important to have accessible and sustainable transportation options. This project would convert Langstrasse into a car-free street, making it easier and safer for pedestrians and cyclists to get around. It would also promote sustainability by reducing the number of cars on the road.",

This project aligns with my interest in sustainability and urban greenery.  #19 - More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord, Transportation, 10000) As a student, I believe that having more night buses available would greatly benefit those of us who often have late-night commitments, such as studying or working. This project would improve the accessibility and safety of public transportation in Zurich.  #17 - A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd, Nature, 10000) I think it's important to have community gardens in urban areas, as they provide a space for residents to come together and grow their own food. This project aligns with my interest in sustainable living and community building.  #4 - Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West, Culture, 5000) I believe that creating a community-driven library for sharing goods and resources would foster a sense of community and reduce waste. This project aligns with my interest in sustainable consumption and community engagement.  #1 - Car-free Langstrasse (West, Transportation, 10000) As a student who uses public transportation regularly, I believe that creating a car-free street would improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, and make the area more pedestrian-friendly.

After reviewing the list of projects, here are my top 5 choices for the participatory budgeting program in Zurich:  #2 Car-free Langstrasse (West) - I believe that creating a car-free street will promote sustainable transportation and improve the quality of life for residents and visitors. It will also encourage people to explore the city on foot or by bike, which can help reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.  #10 Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost) - As a university student, I think it's important to have green spaces and festivals that celebrate nature in the city. This project will not only add beauty to the city centre but also promote sustainability and environmental awareness.  #18 Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen (S\u00fcd) - I believe that providing free public spaces for recreation and relaxation is essential for a livable city. The Free Open Badi Space project will offer a unique opportunity for residents to enjoy the outdoors and connect with their community.  #14 Free Bike Fixing Workshops (S\u00fcd) - As a student on a budget, I understand the importance of having affordable transportation options. This project will not only save students money but also promote sustainable transportation and reduce waste by encouraging bike repairs rather than replacement.  #7 Speed bumps in the City and the Lake Front (Ost) - As a pedestrian and cyclist, I believe that safety is a top priority. Installing speed bumps will help regulate traffic speed and create a safer environment for all road users. It's a simple yet effective solution that can make a big difference in the community.  I hope my votes contribute to creating positive change in Zurich!",

Adding more night buses to Oerlikon would provide students and residents with a safe and convenient way to get home late at night, reducing the need for private cars and promoting sustainability.  #17 - A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd, Nature, 10000) I believe that creating a neighborhood garden in Wiedikon would not only provide a green space for residents to enjoy but also foster a sense of community. This project promotes sustainability and allows residents to grow their own fruits and vegetables, reducing the carbon footprint of food production and transportation.  #13 - Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd, Transportation, 10000) As a student, I know that owning a car can be expensive and environmentally harmful. A car-sharing system specifically designed for young people would provide an affordable and sustainable transportation option, reducing the number of private cars on the road and promoting environmental responsibility.  #10 - Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost, Culture, 5000) I believe that hosting a plant festival in the city center would not only showcase the beauty of plants but also promote sustainability and environmental awareness.

It would also help to promote sustainability and reduce the urban heat island effect.  #18 - Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen (S\u00fcd) - CHF 5,000 As a student on a budget, I think it's great to have free or low-cost recreational activities available. A free open badi space would be a great way to relax and enjoy the outdoors during the summer months.  #13 - Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd) - CHF 10,000 I believe that car sharing is a sustainable and convenient way to get around the city, especially for students who may not have access to a car. A car sharing system specifically for young people would be a great way to reduce our carbon footprint and promote environmentally-friendly transportation.  #8 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - CHF 5,000 As a cyclist, I think it's important to have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. This project would help to improve the safety and accessibility of cycling in Zurich, making it a more attractive mode of transportation for students and residents alike.  #1 - Car-free Langstrasse (West) - CHF 10,000 I believe that creating a car-free zone in the city would be a great way to promote sustainability, reduce traffic congestion, and improve air quality.

Installing speed bumps would help regulate vehicle speeds and create a safer environment for everyone.  #1 - Car-free Langstrasse (West) - As a student, I think it's essential to have more car-free spaces in the city.

Here are the five projects I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #23 - Footpath Gardens around Train Stations (Nord, Nature, 10000) I think it's important to make public spaces more beautiful and enjoyable for everyone. This project would create green areas around train stations, which would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of the area but also provide a peaceful oasis for commuters and residents alike.  #18 - Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen (S\u00fcd, Nature, 5000) As a student on a budget, I appreciate free public spaces where I can relax and enjoy the outdoors. This project would create a free open-air bathing space in Wollishofen, which would be a great spot to cool off during the summer months.  #13 - Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd, Transportation, 10000) As a student, I don't have a car, and public transportation can sometimes be inconvenient or expensive. This project would establish a car-sharing system specifically for young people, which would provide an affordable and convenient way to get around the city.  #8 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost, Transportation, 5000) I'm a big fan of cycling as a mode of transportation. This project would create dedicated bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse, making it safer and easier for cyclists to navigate the city.  #1 - Car-free Langstrasse (West, Transportation, 10000) Langstrasse is a popular street in Zurich that's currently dominated by cars. This project would transform the street into a car-free zone, creating a more pedestrian-friendly and enjoyable public space for everyone to enjoy.",

This project would not only improve the aesthetic of the area but also provide a calming environment for commuters and residents alike.  #19 - More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord, Transportation, 10000) As a student, I often have late-night commitments, such as studying or social events. Having more night buses available would make it easier for me to get home safely and conveniently, especially in areas like Oerlikon where public transportation is limited.  #17 - A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd, Nature, 10000) I believe that community gardens are an excellent way to bring people together and promote sustainability. This project would create a shared green space for residents of Wiedikon to grow their own fruits and vegetables, fostering a sense of community and environmental responsibility.  #13 - Car Sharing System for Young People (S\u00fcd, Transportation, 10000) As a student on a budget, I think a car-sharing system would be an affordable and convenient way to get around the city without relying on personal vehicles. This project would cater specifically to young people, making it easier for us to travel sustainably and save money on transportation costs.  #10 - Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost, Culture, 5000) I think it's important to celebrate and appreciate nature, especially in urban environments. This project would bring a fun and educational plant festival to the city centre, promoting sustainability and community engagement. Additionally, it would provide an opportunity for local artists and performers to showcase their talents.",

Creating footpath gardens around train stations would not only add beauty to the city but also provide a peaceful atmosphere for commuters and residents alike.  #17, A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon (S\u00fcd) - CHF 10,000 As a student living in Wiedikon, I would love to have a neighborhood garden in my area where I can grow my own fruits and vegetables, meet fellow residents, and enjoy some fresh air. This project aligns with my personal values of sustainability and community building.  #10, Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost) - CHF 5,000 I believe that a plant festival in the city centre would be an excellent way to bring some greenery and life to the urban space. It would also provide an opportunity for locals and visitors to learn about different plant species and their importance in our ecosystem.  #7, Speed bumps in the City and the Lake Front (Ost) - CHF 10,000 As a pedestrian and cyclist, I believe that speed bumps are essential to ensure safety on our roads. Installing speed bumps in key areas of the city and lake front would encourage drivers to slow down and reduce the risk of accidents.  #3, Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids (West) - CHF 10,000 As a student on a budget, I understand the importance of cooking healthy meals without breaking the bank. A sustainable cooking workshop for kids would not only teach young people important life skills but also promote environmental awareness and sustainability.",

After reviewing the list of projects, here are my top 5 choices for the participatory budgeting program in Zurich:  #23 - Footpath Gardens around Train Stations (Nord, Nature, 10000) I believe that green spaces around train stations can greatly enhance the urban environment and provide a pleasant atmosphere for commuters and residents alike. This project aligns with my personal interest in sustainability and urban greenery.  #15 - Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse (S\u00fcd, Culture, 10000) I think that car-free events can help reduce pollution and promote a more livable city. This project will not only benefit the environment but also provide a platform for community building and cultural activities.  #12 - Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost, Nature, 5000) This project caught my attention as it focuses on utilizing existing urban spaces to create gardens, which can help purify the air and provide a peaceful oasis in the city. I believe that small-scale initiatives like this can have a significant impact on the overall quality of life in Zurich.  #7 - Speed bumps in the City and the Lake Front (Ost, Transportation, 10000) As a student who often walks and uses public transportation, I believe that speed bumps can help slow down traffic and improve pedestrian safety. This project aligns with my interest in urban mobility and safety.  #3 - Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids (West, Culture, 10000) I think it's essential to educate children about sustainable practices and healthy eating habits from a young age. This project not only promotes sustainability but also fosters intergenerational learning and community building.

Here are my votes:  #24 Planting Workshops at Oerlikon - I believe that planting workshops can help to create a sense of community and improve the aesthetic appeal of the area.  #19 More Night Buses to Oerlikon - As a student, I appreciate having reliable and accessible transportation options, especially at night when public transportation is limited.  #17 A Neighborhood Garden for Wiedikon - Community gardens can help foster a sense of community and provide green spaces in urban areas.  #13 Car Sharing System for Young People - I think that car sharing systems can reduce traffic congestion, lower emissions, and make transportation more affordable for young people.  #10 Plant Festival in the City Centre - A plant festival could bring some greenery and life to the city centre, making it a more enjoyable place to spend time.",
