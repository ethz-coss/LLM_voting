Here are the projects I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord, Transportation, 5000 CHF) - As a student who relies on cycling to get around the city, I think it's important to have safe bike paths, especially in areas like Irchel Park where there are many pedestrians and cyclists.  #9 Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd, Culture, 5000 CHF) - I believe it's important to educate children about environmental issues and promote sustainability from a young age. This project seems like a fun and engaging way to do that.  #14 More Trees in Bellevue & Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz (Ost, Nature, 10000 CHF) - I think it's important to have more green spaces in the city, especially in areas with high foot traffic like Bellevue and Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz. This project would not only improve the aesthetic of the area but also help with air quality and provide shade during hot summer days.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost, Transportation, 5000 CHF) - As a cyclist, I think it's important to have dedicated bike lanes to ensure safety and prevent accidents. Seefeldstrasse is a popular route for cyclists, so I believe this project would be beneficial for many people.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West, Culture, 5000 CHF) - I think it's great to have community-driven projects that promote sustainability and encourage people to share resources. This project seems like a unique way to do that, and it's located in my neighborhood, so I would love to see it come to life.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West, Transportation, 5000 CHF) - As someone who has had to move apartments in Zurich before, I know how stressful and expensive it can be. This project would provide a free and sustainable solution for people who need to transport large items, which I think is a great idea.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West, Transportation, 10000 CHF) - I believe that reducing car traffic in the city is essential for improving air quality and making public spaces more enjoyable. Langstrasse is a popular area with many pedestrians and cyclists, so I think it would be great to make it car-free.  Overall",

A plant festival would be a great way to celebrate nature and raise awareness about the importance of conservation.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - This project would provide a convenient and sustainable way for people to move their belongings, reducing the need for cars and promoting cycling.

More night buses would make it easier for me and other students to get home safely after a late night at the library or a social event.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost) - I think it's important to have more green spaces in the city, especially in areas with a lot of concrete like Ost. Transforming underutilized spaces under trees into gardens would not only make the city more beautiful, but also provide a peaceful oasis for residents and visitors alike.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a cyclist, I appreciate dedicated bike lanes that keep me safe from car traffic. Seefeldstrasse is a busy street with a lot of cyclists, so adding bike lanes would make it easier and safer for everyone to get around.  #22 Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids (West) - I believe that teaching children about sustainable cooking practices and healthy eating habits is important for their development and the future of our planet. This project would not only benefit the kids who participate, but also their families and the community as a whole.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West) - As a student who lives in the city center, I think it's important to have car-free spaces that promote walkability and community interaction. Langstrasse is already a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, and making it car-free would only enhance its appeal and create a more enjoyable atmosphere.",

I also think it's important to encourage cycling and make it easier for people to fix their bikes, which is why I voted for the free bike fixing workshops. Additionally, I believe that car-free Sundays and bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse would make the city more livable and reduce traffic congestion. Finally, I think a public bicycle moving trailer would be a useful resource for residents, especially students who may not have access to cars.",

Having more night buses would make it easier for me to get home safely and affordably, without having to rely on expensive taxis or ride-sharing services.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - I think it's important to have more green spaces in the city, especially in areas like Ost where there are fewer parks. Transforming underutilized spaces under trees into gardens would add beauty and tranquility to the area, and provide a peaceful oasis for residents and visitors alike.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - As a student who often bikes around the city, I think it's important to have dedicated bike lanes, especially on busy streets like Seefeldstrasse. This would make cycling safer and more accessible for everyone.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen - I love the idea of a community-based sharing library where people can exchange goods and services. This would promote sustainability, reduce waste, and foster a sense of community among residents.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - As a student who has moved around a lot, I know how stressful and expensive it can be to transport belongings. A public bicycle moving trailer would provide an affordable and eco-friendly solution for people who need to move items within the city.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As a student who walks and bikes around the city, I think it's important to have car-free spaces that promote pedestrian and cycling-friendly infrastructure.

Here are the projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park - As a student who relies on cycling to get around the city, I think it's important to have safe and accessible bike paths, especially in areas with high foot traffic like Irchel Park.  #6 More Night Buses to Oerlikon - As a student who often has late-night commitments, I would appreciate having more night bus options available to get back home safely and conveniently.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - I think it's a great idea to utilize the space under trees in the city to create gardens, which can help improve air quality and provide a peaceful oasis for residents and visitors alike.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - As a cyclist, I believe that dedicated bike lanes are essential for safe and efficient transportation. Seefeldstrasse is a busy road, and having bike lanes would encourage more people to cycle and reduce the risk of accidents.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen - I think this project is a great way to promote sustainability and community engagement. It encourages people to share resources and reduce waste, which is beneficial for the environment and residents' wallets.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As a student who believes in reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable transportation, I think making Langstrasse car-free would be a great initiative. It would encourage people to use alternative modes of transportation like cycling, walking, or taking public transport, and reduce traffic congestion and pollution in the area.",

This project would improve the safety of cyclists and encourage more people to use sustainable transportation.  #10 Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse (S\u00fcd, Culture, 10000) - I think it's great to have events that promote sustainable transportation and community building. A car-free festival would be a fun way to bring people together and showcase the beauty of Mutschellenstrasse.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost, Transportation, 5000) - As a cyclist, I know how important it is to have dedicated bike lanes that are safe and well-maintained. This project would improve the infrastructure for cycling in the city and make it easier for people to get around sustainably.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West, Culture, 5000) - I love the idea of a community-based library where people can exchange goods and services. This project would promote sharing and collaboration within the community and reduce waste.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West, Transportation, 10000) - As a student who lives near Langstrasse, I think it's important to make this street more pedestrian-friendly and reduce the amount of traffic.

This project would not only promote sustainable transportation but also provide a fun community event for locals and students alike.  #12 Car Sharing System for Young People - As a student on a budget, affording a car can be tough. A car-sharing system would be an affordable and environmentally friendly alternative that would allow me to get around the city without breaking the bank.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - Another project that promotes sustainable transportation, bike lanes would make getting around the city safer and more accessible for students like me who prefer to bike.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen - As a student, it can be tough to afford all the things we need. A community exchange library would provide an opportunity for us to borrow what we need without having to buy everything ourselves, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - A car-free street would not only reduce traffic and pollution but also create a more vibrant and inviting community space for students and locals alike.

Here are the projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park - As a student, I think it's important to have safe bike paths, especially around popular parks like Irchel. This would encourage more people to use bikes as a mode of transportation, reducing traffic and promoting sustainability.  #9 Environmental Film Session for Kids - I believe it's important to educate children about environmental issues from a young age. This project would not only promote sustainability but also provide an opportunity for kids to learn about the importance of protecting our environment.  #11 Free Bike Fixing Workshops - As a student on a budget, I think it's great to have free bike fixing workshops available. This would encourage more people to use bikes and reduce waste by repairing old bikes instead of buying new ones.  #16 Multicultural Festival at Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz - Zurich is a diverse city, and I think it's important to celebrate our different cultures. This project would promote intercultural understanding and provide a platform for people to learn about different traditions and customs.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - This project would provide a sustainable and convenient way for people to move their belongings, reducing the need for fossil fuel-based transportation. As a student, I think this would be a great resource for moving into or out of apartments.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - Langstrasse is a popular area for students and young people, and I think it would be great to make it car-free. This would promote sustainability, reduce noise pollution, and create a more enjoyable atmosphere in the area.",

This would not only reduce pollution but also promote community building and create a more relaxed atmosphere.  #18 Speed bumps in the City and the Lake Front - As a pedestrian, I think it's important to have speed bumps in busy areas to slow down traffic and ensure pedestrian safety. This would make the city a safer place for everyone.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen - I believe that sharing resources is an excellent way to promote sustainability, and a community things exchange library would be a great addition to the city. It would encourage people to share items they no longer need, reducing waste and promoting community involvement.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - This project would provide a convenient way for people to move their belongings sustainably. It would also promote cycling as a mode of transportation and reduce the number of cars on the road.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As a student, I think it's important to have car-free areas in the city, especially in popular shopping districts like Langstrasse. This would promote sustainability, reduce traffic congestion and create a more enjoyable shopping experience.",

Here are the projects I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park - As a student, I believe that safety should be a top priority, especially when it comes to transportation. This project would help ensure that cyclists have a safe route around the park, which would encourage more people to use eco-friendly transportation methods.  #9 Environmental Film Session for Kids - I think it's important to educate children about environmental issues and promote sustainability from a young age. This project would help do just that, while also providing an entertaining and engaging experience for kids.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - As a student on a budget, I appreciate any initiatives that make the city more beautiful and enjoyable without breaking the bank. This project would help create more green spaces in the city, which would be perfect for studying, relaxing, or spending time with friends.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - As a student who relies on public transportation, I know how important it is to have safe and convenient bike lanes. This project would help improve the connectivity of the city's bike lane network and make it easier for cyclists to get around.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen - I love the idea of a community-driven library where people can exchange goods and services. This project would promote sustainability, reduce waste, and foster a sense of community among students and residents.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As a student who often walks or bikes around the city, I think it's important to prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety. This project would help create a more enjoyable and safer environment for everyone, while also promoting sustainable transportation methods.",

Here are the projects I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park - As a student, I believe that safe bike paths are essential for commuting to and from university, and this project would improve the safety of cyclists in the Nord district.  #6 More Night Buses to Oerlikon - Having more night buses would make it easier for students to get around the city at night, especially after events or activities that end late. This would be particularly useful for students who live in the Nord district.  #7 Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen - As a student on a budget, I think it's important to have affordable recreational spaces. A free open-air swimming pool in Wollishofen would be a great way to relax and enjoy the summer months without breaking the bank.  #9 Environmental Film Session for Kids - I believe that educating children about environmental issues is crucial for creating a sustainable future. This project would engage kids on environmental topics and promote sustainability in the long term.  #11 Free Bike Fixing Workshops - As a student, I know that bikes are an essential mode of transportation. Free bike fixing workshops would enable students to keep their bikes in good condition without having to spend money on repairs. This would be particularly useful for students living in the S\u00fcd district.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - This project would create more green spaces in the city, which would not only improve air quality but also provide a peaceful oasis for students to relax and study.  #15 Plant Festival in the City Centre - A plant festival in the city center would be a great way to bring together students and residents from different parts of Zurich. It would also promote sustainability and environmental awareness.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - This project would provide a convenient and eco-friendly way for students to move their belongings around the city, reducing the need for cars and trucks.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As a student, I believe that reducing car traffic in the city center would make it more pedestrian-friendly and promote sustainable transportation. A car-free Langstrasse would be a great step towards achieving this goal.",

Based on my personal interests and priorities as a university student in Zurich, here are the projects I would vote for:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park - As a student who relies on cycling to get around the city, I think it's important to have safe and accessible bike paths, especially in areas with high foot traffic like Irchel Park.  #6 More Night Buses to Oerlikon - As a student on a budget, I often have late-night commitments and need reliable transportation options. Adding more night buses to Oerlikon would make it easier for me and other students to get home safely at night.  #7 Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen - During the summer months, it's important to have access to outdoor spaces where I can relax and enjoy the sunshine. A free open-air bathing space in Wollishofen would be a great addition to the city's recreational offerings.  #15 Plant Festival in the City Centre - As someone who appreciates nature and greenery, I think a plant festival in the city center would be a wonderful way to bring some life and color to the urban space. It could also serve as an opportunity for local plant enthusiasts to share their knowledge and passion with the community.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - As a cyclist, I know how important it is to have dedicated bike lanes that are safe and well-maintained. Adding bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse would make it easier for me and other cyclists to navigate the city without worrying about cars or pedestrians.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - This project caught my attention because I've had instances where I needed to move items from one place to another but didn't have access to a car. A public bicycle moving trailer would be a practical and sustainable solution that could help me and other students in similar situations.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As someone who believes in the importance of reducing carbon emissions, I think making Langstrasse car-free would be a step in the right direction. It would also create a more pedestrian-friendly atmosphere and encourage people to explore the area on foot or by bike.",

Based on my personal interests and priorities as a university student in Zurich, I would vote for the following projects:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - As a student who relies on cycling to get around the city, I think it's important to have safe bike paths, especially in areas with high foot traffic like Irchel Park.  #6 More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord) - As a student on a budget, I often rely on public transportation to get around the city, especially at night when the trains have stopped running. Having more night buses available would make it easier for me and my fellow students to get home safely after a late night of studying or socializing.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost) - I think it's important to have green spaces in the city, not just for environmental reasons but also for mental health and well-being. Transforming underutilized spaces under trees into gardens would be a great way to add more greenery to the city and create relaxing areas for residents to enjoy.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a cyclist, I appreciate dedicated bike lanes that keep me safe from car traffic. Adding bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse would make it easier and safer for me and other cyclists to get around the city.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West) - I think it's great to have community-driven initiatives that promote sustainability and reduce waste. A community things exchange library would be a fantastic resource for residents to share items they no longer need, reducing the need for new purchases and promoting reuse and recycling.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - This project would provide a convenient and sustainable way for residents to move items around the city without relying on cars or delivery services. As a student who has had to move apartments several times, I can see the value in having a public bicycle moving trailer available for use.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West) - As a pedestrian and cyclist, I appreciate car-free zones that prioritize people over cars. Making Langstrasse car-free would create a more enjoyable and safer environment for residents and visitors alike.",

More night buses would give me more options and peace of mind when traveling at night.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - As a student on a budget, I love spending time in nature, but it can be hard to find green spaces in the city. This project would create more areas for me to relax, study, or meet with friends.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - I live in the Ost district and frequently bike along Seefeldstrasse. Dedicated bike lanes would make my commute safer and more enjoyable.  #22 Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids - As a student, I'm passionate about sustainability and love working with children. This project combines both interests and would be a great way for me to engage with the community while learning new skills.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As a resident of Zurich, I believe that reducing car traffic is essential for the health and sustainability of our city.

This would make cycling a safer and more appealing mode of transportation.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - This project would provide a convenient and sustainable way for people to move their belongings, reducing the need for cars and trucks on the road.

This project would not only educate children but also encourage them to take an interest in sustainability.  #11 Free Bike Fixing Workshops - As a student on a budget, I think this project would be really useful for students who want to save money by fixing their own bikes. It's also a great way to promote sustainable transportation.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - I love the idea of turning unused spaces into gardens. It would make the city more beautiful and provide more green spaces for people to relax in.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - This is a busy street that many students use to get to university, so dedicated bike lanes would make it much safer for cyclists.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - I think this is a great idea for students who need to move around the city but don't have a car. It would be a convenient and sustainable way to transport things.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As a student who lives in the city center, I think it would be great to have more car-free areas like Langstrasse.

I believe that hands-on learning experiences can be incredibly valuable, especially when it comes to teaching children about the environment and conservation.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - As a student on a budget, I think this project would be an excellent resource for those who need to transport items but don't have access to a car.

Here are the projects I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park - As a student, I rely heavily on my bike to get around the city, and safety is a top priority. Improving bike paths and making them safer would encourage more people to use sustainable transportation.  #6 More Night Buses to Oerlikon - As a student on a budget, I often have late nights studying or socializing, and public transportation options are limited at night. Adding more night buses would make it easier for me and my fellow students to get home safely without breaking the bank.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - As a student, I appreciate green spaces and love spending time outdoors.Transforming city spaces under trees into gardens would create more areas for relaxation, study, and recreation.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - Again, as a student who relies on cycling, bike lanes are essential for my safety and peace of mind. Adding bike lanes to Seefeldstrasse would make it easier for me to get around the city efficiently and safely.  #19 Bird Houses for Zurich-H\u00f6ngg - I believe that preserving biodiversity is crucial, and bird houses can help provide habitat for various species of birds. As a student interested in sustainability, I think this project would contribute to making Zurich a more livable city.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen - As a student on a budget, I'm always looking for ways to save money and reduce waste. A community things exchange library would provide an opportunity for people to share resources and reduce consumption, which aligns with my values.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - This project would provide a sustainable and affordable solution for moving large items, reducing the need for fossil-fuel-powered moving trucks. As a student who has had to move several times, I see the value in having this resource available.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As a student who believes in reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable transportation, making Langstrasse car-free would encourage more people to walk, bike or use public transportation. This would contribute to a healthier, more environmentally friendly city.",

Here are the projects I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park - As a student, I think it's important to have safe and accessible bike paths, especially around popular parks like Irchel. This would encourage more people to use sustainable transportation and enjoy the outdoors.  #6 More Night Buses to Oerlikon - As a student on a budget, I often have late nights studying or socializing with friends. Having more night buses would make it easier for me to get home safely and affordably.  #7 Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen - A free open-air swimming pool would be a great addition to the city, especially during the summer months. It would provide a fun and relaxing spot for students and residents alike.  #9 Environmental Film Session for Kids - I believe it's important to educate children about environmental issues and promote sustainability from a young age. This project would do just that, while also providing an entertaining and engaging experience for kids.  #11 Free Bike Fixing Workshops - As a student, I appreciate any opportunity to save money and be more sustainable. Free bike fixing workshops would allow me to keep my bike in good condition without breaking the bank.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - This project would not only beautify the city but also provide more green spaces for residents and students to enjoy. It's a great way to bring some natural tranquility to urban areas.  #15 Plant Festival in the City Centre - A plant festival would be a fun and unique event that celebrates nature and sustainability. It would also bring some color and vibrancy to the city centre, making it a more enjoyable place to spend time.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - As a student who often bikes around the city, I think it's important to have designated bike lanes that are safe and accessible. This project would improve the infrastructure for cyclists and encourage more people to use sustainable transportation.  #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - This project would provide a convenient and sustainable way for students and residents to move items around the city without relying on cars or public transportation. It's a practical solution that aligns with Zurich's goals of reducing carbon emissions.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse - As a student, I believe that reducing car use and promoting sustainable transportation is crucial for the environment and our health.
