This project would create a free outdoor swimming area in Wollishofen, promoting physical activity and community building.  #3: Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd) - Raising awareness about environmental issues is crucial for the next generation. This project would organize film screenings and workshops for kids to learn about sustainability and conservation, promoting a green mindset from an early age.  #4: Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a student who relies on cycling to get around the city, I think this project is essential for improving cyclist safety and infrastructure. Dedicated bike lanes would encourage more people to use eco-friendly transportation and reduce traffic congestion.  #5: Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse (S\u00fcd) - This project would close off a street to cars on Sundays, creating a pedestrian-friendly area for residents to enjoy.

Here are my preferences for the participatory budgeting program in Zurich, with my top 5 selected projects ranked from most preferred to fifth most preferred:  #19: Bird Houses for Zurich-H\u00f6ngg (West, Nature, 5000) - I think this project is a great idea because it promotes biodiversity and provides a habitat for birds in an urban area. It's also a relatively small project with a low cost, so the impact on the budget is minimal.  #14: More Trees in Bellevue & Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz (Ost, Nature, 10000) - I believe that adding more trees to public spaces can greatly improve the quality of life for residents and visitors. This project will not only make the area more beautiful but also provide shade, clean the air, and create a more pleasant atmosphere.  #23: Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West, Transportation, 5000) - As a student, I think this project is an excellent idea because it promotes sustainable transportation and makes it easier for people to move around the city without relying on cars. The cost is also relatively low, so it's a great value for the money.  #13: Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost, Nature, 5000) - I love this project because it takes underutilized spaces and turns them into beautiful gardens. It's a creative way to bring more greenery to the city and make public spaces more enjoyable for everyone.  #21: Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West, Culture, 5000) - I think this project is a great way to promote sustainability and community engagement. By creating a platform for people to exchange goods and services, it encourages sharing and reduces waste. It's also a relatively small project with a low cost, so the impact on the budget is minimal.  Overall, I believe that these projects will improve the quality of life for residents and visitors in Zurich while promoting sustainability and community engagement.",

This project would create more gardens in the city, improving air quality, providing natural habitats for wildlife, and creating recreational spaces for residents. 2. #18 - Speed bumps in the City and the Lake Front (Ost) - As a pedestrian and cyclist, I believe that speed bumps are essential to slow down traffic and improve safety on our roads. Installing speed bumps in key areas of the city will help reduce accidents and make our streets more livable. 3. #21 - Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West) - As a student, I understand the importance of sustainability and reducing waste. This project promotes both by creating a community-driven library for sharing goods and resources. It also fosters community engagement and collaboration, which is vital for building strong neighborhoods. 4. #5 - Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - As a cyclist, I know how important it is to have safe bike lanes in the city. This project would improve the safety of cyclists and pedestrians by creating separate bike paths and improving lighting around Irchel Park. 5. #23 - Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - I believe that cycling should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial means. This project would provide a public bicycle trailer that can be borrowed for free, making it easier for people to move goods and supplies around the city without relying on cars.  These projects align with my values of sustainability, community engagement, and transportation safety. I believe that investing in these initiatives will contribute to a better quality of life for residents in Zurich.",

This project would not only benefit the environment but also foster a sense of community among residents. 3. #15 Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost) - As a student on a tight budget, I appreciate any initiatives that bring greenery and beauty to the city without breaking the bank. This festival would not only be a great way to enjoy nature but also promote sustainability and community building. 4. #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - As someone who frequently moves house, I know how stressful and expensive it can be to transport belongings. A public bicycle moving trailer would not only save me money but also reduce carbon emissions from traditional moving vehicles. 5. #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West) - Another important priority for me is reducing the reliance on cars in the city. By making Langstrasse car-free, we can create a more pedestrian-friendly and environmentally sustainable area that benefits both residents and visitors.

This festival sounds like a great way to do just that! 2. #6 More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord) - As a student, I know how important it is to have reliable and convenient public transportation options, especially at night when the streets can be less safe. Adding more night buses to Oerlikon would make it easier for people to get around without a car. 3. #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - I believe that investing in bike infrastructure is crucial for creating a more sustainable and livable city. This project would help to promote cycling as a mode of transportation and make it safer for cyclists. 4. #10 Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse (S\u00fcd) - I think it's great to have car-free days in the city, as they promote sustainability and community building. This project would also support local businesses and encourage people to explore their neighborhoods on foot or by bike. 5. #19 Bird Houses for Zurich-H\u00f6ngg (West) - I believe that it's important to protect and preserve the natural world, even in urban areas. This project would help to provide habitats for birds and other wildlife, making the city a more biodiverse and beautiful place.",

Here are my preferences for the participatory budgeting program in Zurich, ranked from most preferred to fifth most preferred:  1. #5 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - As a student who relies on cycling as a mode of transportation, I think it's important to ensure the safety of cyclists, especially around popular parks like Irchel. This project would help create dedicated bike paths and improve overall traffic flow in the area. 2. #15 Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost) - As someone who enjoys spending time outdoors and appreciates urban green spaces, I think a plant festival in the city centre would be a great addition to Zurich's cultural scene. It would not only add some natural beauty to the area but also provide an opportunity for locals to learn about different plant species and gardening techniques. 3. #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - Another transportation-related project that I support is the creation of bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse. This would make it easier and safer for cyclists to navigate the area, which is currently a busy thoroughfare for both cars and bikes. 4. #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West) - I believe that fostering a sense of community and sustainability is important, especially in urban areas. A community-driven library that allows people to exchange goods and services would promote these values while also reducing waste and promoting collaboration. 5. #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West) - As someone who believes in the importance of reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable transportation, I think a car-free Langstrasse would be a great initiative for Zurich.

This project will provide safe bike lanes for cyclists, encouraging more people to switch from cars to bikes. * Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids (#22): I think it's crucial to educate children about sustainable living practices and healthy eating habits. This project offers a unique opportunity to teach kids about sustainable cooking methods, promoting environmental awareness and healthy lifestyles. * Environmental Film Session for Kids (#9): Raising awareness about environmental issues is vital for the future of our planet. This project will provide an engaging platform for kids to learn about environmental topics, inspiring them to take action and make a positive impact. * Kid Festival at Leutschenpark (#3): As a student, I understand the importance of having accessible and fun events for families and children in the community. This project will provide a free festival for kids, promoting joy and unity among residents. * Car-free Langstrasse (#24): Reducing car traffic is essential for creating a more livable city. By making Langstrasse car-free, we can promote sustainable transportation, reduce air pollution, and create a more pleasant atmosphere for pedestrians and cyclists.

It's a simple yet effective solution that can make a big difference in reducing accidents and improving urban mobility.  #24, Car-free Langstrasse - As a student, I believe that creating more car-free spaces in the city can greatly enhance the quality of life for residents and promote sustainable transportation. This project has the potential to transform a busy street into a vibrant public space that encourages community interaction and supports local businesses.  #16, Multicultural Festival at Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz - As an international student, I appreciate the diversity of Zurich's cultural scene, and this project celebrates that diversity while promoting intercultural understanding and exchange. It's a great way to bring people together and foster a sense of community.  #10, Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse - This project aligns with my interest in creating more public spaces that promote community engagement and sustainable transportation. By closing the street to cars, it creates an opportunity for residents to socialize, enjoy local performances, and explore the surrounding area in a safe and relaxed environment.  #5, Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park - As an occasional cyclist, I recognize the importance of safe bike infrastructure in Zurich. This project addresses a specific safety concern while promoting cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation. It's a practical investment that can benefit both residents and visitors to the city.",

Here are my choices, ranked from most preferred to fifth most preferred:  1. #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a student who relies on cycling for transportation, I believe that dedicated bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse would greatly improve the safety and accessibility of the city's cycling infrastructure. 2. #10 Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse (S\u00fcd) - As a resident of Zurich, I appreciate the initiative to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable transportation. A car-free festival would not only benefit the environment but also foster a sense of community among residents. 3. #15 Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost) - As someone who enjoys spending time outdoors, I think a plant festival in the city centre would be a wonderful way to bring some greenery and life to the urban space. It would also promote sustainability and environmental awareness. 4. #23 Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - This project aligns with my interests in sustainable transportation and community sharing initiatives. A public bicycle moving trailer would encourage cycling and reduce the need for cars, while also providing a convenient service for residents. 5. #9 Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd) - I believe that educating children about environmental issues is crucial in fostering a sustainable future. An environmental film session for kids would not only entertain but also raise awareness and promote eco-friendly practices among the younger generation.  I hope my votes contribute to making Zurich an even more livable and sustainable city!",

Here are my preferences:  1. #23 - Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - Transportation - 5000 CHF I believe that promoting sustainable transportation options is essential for a city like Zurich. A public bicycle moving trailer would encourage people to use bikes more often, reducing traffic congestion and pollution. It's also a cost-effective and practical solution for residents who need to move goods or equipment around the city. 2. #17 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - Transportation - 5000 CHF As a student, I rely heavily on my bike to get around the city. The lack of dedicated bike lanes in some areas can be frustrating and unsafe. Creating bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse would improve the safety of cyclists and encourage more people to use bikes as a mode of transportation. 3. #19 - Bird Houses for Zurich-H\u00f6ngg (West) - Nature - 5000 CHF As a resident of Zurich, I appreciate the beauty and importance of preserving nature within the city. Installing bird houses in Zurich-H\u00f6ngg would not only provide a habitat for birds but also serve as an educational opportunity for residents to learn about local wildlife. 4. #6 - More Night Buses to Oerlikon (Nord) - Transportation - 10000 CHF As a student, I often have late nights studying or socializing with friends. Having more night buses available would make it easier and safer for me to get home, especially during the winter months when the days are shorter. 5. #16 - Multicultural Festival at Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz (Ost) - Culture - 10000 CHF Zurich is a diverse city, and I believe that celebrating our cultural differences is essential for building a strong community. A multicultural festival at Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz would provide an excellent opportunity for residents to come together, learn from each other, and appreciate the various cultures that make up our city.  These are my top 5 preferences, and I believe they align well with my interests as a university student in Zurich.",

Here are my preferences for the participatory budgeting program in Zurich:  #1: Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse (S\u00fcd) - I believe that creating car-free spaces in urban areas is important for promoting sustainability and community building. This project would not only provide a fun and festive atmosphere, but also encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.  #2: Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a student who relies on cycling as a primary mode of transportation, I believe that dedicated bike lanes are essential for improving safety and accessibility. This project would help to create a more cycle-friendly city and encourage more people to switch to sustainable transportation options.  #3: Free Bike Fixing Workshops (S\u00fcd) - As a cyclist, I understand the importance of maintaining a well-functioning bike. However, many people may not have the skills or resources to repair their bikes. This project would provide free workshops for residents to learn how to fix their bikes and promote sustainable transportation.  #4: Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd) - I believe that educating children about environmental issues is crucial in creating a more sustainable future. This project would engage young people in discussions about environmental topics and encourage them to take action.  #5: Planting Workshops at Oerlikon (Nord) - Urban gardening is an excellent way to promote sustainability, community building, and mental well-being. This project would provide workshops for residents to learn about planting and maintaining gardens in urban spaces.  These are my top 5 preferences, in order of priority.

After reviewing the projects, here are my top 5 preferences:  1. #3 - Kid Festival at Leutschenpark (Nord) - CHF 5000 I think it's important to invest in community events that bring people together and provide opportunities for children to have fun and learn. This project seems like a great way to do that, and the cost is relatively low. 2. #17 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - CHF 5000 As a student, I think it's important to invest in infrastructure that promotes sustainable transportation. This project would help to create safer and more accessible bike lanes, which would encourage more people to use bicycles as a mode of transportation. 3. #10 - Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse (S\u00fcd) - CHF 10000 I think this project would be a great way to promote sustainable transportation and community building. By closing off the street to cars, it would create a safe and enjoyable space for people to walk, bike, and interact with one another. 4. #22 - Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids (West) - CHF 10000 I believe that teaching children about sustainability and healthy eating is important for their development and future success. This project would provide a fun and interactive way to do that, while also promoting sustainable practices in the community. 5. #13 - Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost) - CHF 5000 I think it's important to invest in projects that promote green spaces and improve the aesthetic appeal of the city. This project would help to create more beautiful and functional public spaces, which would benefit both residents and visitors.  I hope this helps!
