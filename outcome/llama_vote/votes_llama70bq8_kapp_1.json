Here are the five projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #5 - Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - As a student, I rely on my bike to get around the city, and safety is a top priority. Improving the bike paths around Irchel Park would make it easier and safer for me and my fellow students to get to class or explore the city.  #7 - Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen (S\u00fcd) - Who doesn't love a good badi (swimming hole) on a hot summer day? Creating a free, open badi space in Wollishofen would be an awesome way for students like me to relax and cool off during the summer months.  #9 - Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd) - As a student, I believe it's important to educate the next generation about environmental issues and sustainability. Hosting environmental film sessions for kids would be a great way to do this, and would help create a more sustainable future for our city.  #17 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a student, I rely on my bike to get around the city, and having dedicated bike lanes would make it easier and safer for me to navigate the city's streets. Adding bike lanes on Seefeldstrasse would be a great way to improve the city's cycling infrastructure.  #23 - Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - Another great way to promote sustainable transportation in Zurich is by providing public bicycle moving trailers that can be borrowed. This would make it easier for students like me to move around the city without relying on cars or public transportation.",

        "response": "  Sure! Here are the five projects that I would vote for as a university student in Zurich:  #3 Kid Festival at Leutschenpark (Nord, Culture, 5000 CHF) - As a student, I believe it's important to invest in events that bring the community together and promote cultural exchange. The Kid Festival at Leutschenpark seems like a great way to do this, and it's also a relatively affordable project.  #6 Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord, Transportation, 5000 CHF) - As a student who relies on my bike to get around the city, I think it's important to invest in safe and accessible bike infrastructure. The Safe Bike Paths project would help ensure that cyclists can navigate the city safely, and it's a relatively small investment compared to some of the other projects on the list.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost, Nature, 5000 CHF) - I love spending time in nature, and I think it's important for urban spaces to incorporate more greenery. This project would help transform underutilized spaces into beautiful gardens, which would not only benefit the environment but also enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost, Transportation, 5000 CHF) - As a student who often uses public transportation or bikes to get around, I believe that investing in bike infrastructure is crucial for the city's sustainability and livability. The Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse project would help create safer and more accessible routes for cyclists, which would encourage more people to use environmentally-friendly transportation methods.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West, Transportation, 10000 CHF) - As a student who has experienced the congestion and pollution caused by cars in Zurich, I think it's important to invest in projects that promote sustainable transportation. The Car-free Langstrasse project would not only reduce traffic but also create a more inviting and livable public space for residents and visitors. It's a more expensive project, but I believe it would have a significant impact on the city's quality of life.",

Having more night buses available would make it easier for me to get home safely and conveniently without having to worry about the last train.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost) - I love the idea of turning unused spaces in the city into beautiful gardens. It would make the city more enjoyable to live in and also help with sustainability.  #17 Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a cyclist, I think it's important to have dedicated bike lanes, especially on busy streets like Seefeldstrasse. It would make cycling safer and more appealing to people who want to get around the city without using public transportation or driving.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West) - I believe that sharing resources and reducing waste is important for sustainability. A community library for things like tools, kitchen appliances, and other items would encourage people to share and borrow instead of buying new things all the time.

It would provide a fun and relaxing space for students and residents alike.  #15 Plant Festival in the City Centre (Ost) - A plant festival in the city centre would be a great way to bring some greenery and life to the urban space. It would also promote sustainability and environmental awareness, which is important for young people like me.  #21 Dingtheke: Community Things Exchange Library in Wipkingen (West) - I think it's a great idea to have a community-based library where people can exchange goods and services. This would promote sustainability, reduce waste, and foster a sense of community among students and residents.  #24 Car-free Langstrasse (West) - As a student, I think it's important to have car-free spaces in the city to promote sustainable transportation and reduce air pollution. A car-free Langstrasse would be a great way to achieve this, and it would also make the area more enjoyable and accessible for pedestrians and cyclists.",

Having more night buses would make it easier for people to get around without worrying about the last train.  #13 - Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost) - This project caught my attention as I believe that green spaces are essential for a city's well-being and sustainability. Creating more gardens in areas that are currently unused could be a great way to improve the urban environment.  #17 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a cyclist, I think it's important to have dedicated bike lanes to ensure safety and encourage more people to cycle. Seefeldstrasse is a popular route for cyclists, so having designated lanes would make it easier and safer for everyone.  #23 - Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - I like this idea because it promotes sustainable transportation and could encourage people to use bikes more often.

Based on my personal interests and priorities as a university student in Zurich, here are the five projects that I would vote for:  #5 - Safe Bike Paths around Irchel Park (Nord) - As a student who relies on cycling as a mode of transportation, I believe that safe bike paths are essential for a comfortable and secure commute. This project will improve the safety of cyclists and encourage more people to use eco-friendly transportation.  #9 - Environmental Film Session for Kids (S\u00fcd) - As a student interested in environmental sustainability, I believe that educating children about environmental issues is crucial for creating a more sustainable future. This project will provide an engaging and educational experience for kids, promoting environmental awareness and responsibility.  #14 - More Trees in Bellevue & Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz (Ost) - As a student who appreciates the beauty of nature, I believe that adding more trees to public spaces can greatly enhance the quality of life in Zurich. This project will not only provide shade and improve air quality but also create a more pleasant atmosphere for residents and visitors.  #17 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - As a student who frequently uses bike lanes, I believe that dedicated bike lanes are essential for safe and convenient cycling. This project will improve the infrastructure for cyclists, reducing conflicts between cyclists and motor vehicles, and promoting sustainable transportation.  #23 - Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed (West) - As a student who has had to move house several times, I understand the need for affordable and sustainable moving options. This project will provide a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution for residents who need to transport large items, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting active transportation.",

This project would not only improve air quality but also make these public spaces more enjoyable for everyone.  #17 - Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse (Ost) - CHF 5,000 As a cyclist, I know how important it is to have dedicated bike lanes, especially in busy areas. This project would improve the safety of cyclists and encourage more people to use sustainable transportation.  #24 - Car-free Langstrasse (West) - CHF 10,000 I believe that reducing car traffic in urban areas is crucial for creating a more sustainable and livable city.
