Based on my personal interests and priorities for urban projects in Zurich, here are the five projects that I would vote for:  #23 - Footpath Gardens around Train Stations (Nord) - I think this project would enhance the aesthetic appeal of the city's train stations and make them more inviting spaces for residents and visitors alike. It would also promote sustainability by adding greenery to urban areas.  #15 - Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse (S\u00fcd) - I believe that creating car-free zones in the city can help reduce pollution, promote community building, and create a more livable environment. This project would also encourage people to engage in sustainable transportation methods like cycling or walking.  #12 - Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens (Ost) - This project would help to create more green spaces in the city, which can help mitigate the urban heat island effect, improve air quality, and provide a peaceful oasis for residents. It would also enhance the beauty of the city's streets and promote sustainability.  #7 - Speed bumps in the City and the Lake Front (Ost) - I believe that this project would help to improve traffic safety and reduce noise pollution in the city. By installing speed bumps, drivers would be forced to slow down, which can reduce accidents and make the streets more pedestrian-friendly.  #3 - Sustainable Cooking Workshop with Kids (West) - This project would promote sustainability by teaching children about healthy eating habits and how to cook using locally sourced ingredients. It would also encourage young people to develop important life skills like cooking and teamwork.  These five projects align with my values of sustainability, community building, and promoting a livable environment. I believe that they would each have a positive impact on the city and its residents, and I would be proud to see them come to fruition."

After reviewing the project proposals, here are my voting preferences for the participatory budgeting program in Z\u00fcrich:  #21 - Music Studio at Kulturbahnhof Affoltern (Culture) - I believe that investing in cultural infrastructure is important for the city's vibrancy and diversity. A music studio at Kulturbahnhof Affoltern would provide a valuable space for musicians to practice, create, and perform, fostering the local music scene and contributing to the city's cultural richness.  #15 - Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse (Culture) - I think it's important to create more public spaces that promote community engagement and social interaction. Car-free Sunday festivals on Mutschellenstrasse would provide a great opportunity for locals to come together, enjoy live music, food, and other activities, while also promoting sustainable transportation options.  #7 - Speed bumps in the City and the Lake Front (Transportation) - As a resident of Z\u00fcrich, I believe that improving traffic safety is essential for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers alike. Installing speed bumps in key areas of the city and along the lake front would help to reduce speeding, improve traffic flow, and enhance overall road safety.  #13 - Car Sharing System for Young People (Transportation) - I think it's important to encourage sustainable transportation options for young people, who are often looking for affordable and convenient ways to get around the city. A car-sharing system specifically designed for young people would not only reduce traffic congestion but also help to promote environmental responsibility among the next generation of citizens.  #5 - Wet Biotope as Learning Garden in Frankental (Nature) - I believe that investing in green infrastructure is crucial for the health and well-being of urban residents. Creating a wet biotope as a learning garden in Frankental would provide a unique opportunity for citizens to engage with nature, learn about biodiversity, and enjoy outdoor activities, all while helping to improve air quality and mitigate the effects of climate change."
