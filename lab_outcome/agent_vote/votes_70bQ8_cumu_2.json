After reviewing the project proposals, here are my preferences and how I would distribute my 10 points:  #3: Kid Festival at Leutschenpark - 3 points I think it's important to invest in events that bring joy and entertainment to children, especially in a public park like Leutschenpark. This festival would not only provide a fun experience for kids but also promote community building among families in the area.  #6: More Night Buses to Oerlikon - 2 points As someone who occasionally uses public transportation, I believe that having more night buses available would be beneficial for those who work late or enjoy going out in the evenings. It would also reduce the need for personal vehicles and promote sustainable transportation.  #9: Environmental Film Session for Kids - 2 points I think it's crucial to educate children about environmental issues from a young age, and an environmental film session would be an engaging way to do so. It could inspire them to take action and make a positive impact on their surroundings.  #13: Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - 2 points I appreciate the idea of turning unused spaces into green areas, which would not only improve the aesthetic appeal of the city but also contribute to sustainability and biodiversity. This project could also help mitigate the urban heat island effect and provide more opportunities for residents to connect with nature.  #16: Multicultural Festival at Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz - 2 points Zurich is a culturally diverse city, and I believe that celebrating this diversity through events like a multicultural festival would foster greater understanding and community spirit among residents from different backgrounds.  #23: Public Bicycle Moving Trailer to be Borrowed - 1 point While I think promoting sustainable transportation is important, I'm not sure about the feasibility and impact of this project compared to others on the list. However, I still believe it's a good idea and worth allocating a point to.  #24: Car-free Langstrasse - 1 point I appreciate the vision of creating a car-free street in Zurich, but I'm not sure if this project is the most pressing priority for the city. Nevertheless, I believe it's an interesting idea and worth exploring further.  Remaining points (2 points): #7: Free Open Badi Space in Wollishofen and #10: Car-free Sunday Festivals on Mutschellenstrasse  I think both of these projects have the potential to improve the quality of life for residents, especially during the summer months"

Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens would add beauty and tranquility to Zurich's streets, making them more enjoyable for everyone.  #17: Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse - 2 points As a cyclist myself, I believe that investing in bike infrastructure is crucial for promoting sustainable transportation. The Bike Lanes on Seefeldstrasse would provide a safer and more convenient route for cyclists, encouraging more people to choose this environmentally-friendly mode of transportation.  #24: Car-free Langstrasse - 2 points Similar to my previous point, I think that reducing car traffic in urban areas is essential for creating a livable city. The Car-free Langstrasse would not only reduce pollution and noise but also create a more vibrant and enjoyable public space for residents and visitors alike.
