This will encourage drivers to slow down and be more mindful of other road users.  #13 Transforming City Spaces under Trees into Gardens - I believe that creating green spaces in urban areas is essential for improving air quality, providing shade, and promoting biodiversity. Transforming city spaces under trees into gardens would also enhance the aesthetic appeal of the city.  #9 Environmental Film Session for Kids - Educating children about environmental issues is crucial in creating a sustainable future.
